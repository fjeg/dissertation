In this study we present a framework for predicting radiological observations of liver lesions using computational image features. We computed a wide array of computational features from CT images of liver lesions and used these features to train logistic regression and LASSO classifiers. We experimented with other classifiers such as k-nearest-neighbor, support vector machines, and latent discriminant analysis. These methods were severely hampered by such high dimension/low sample sized data, either not reaching any model convergence in training phase, or demonstrating poor results. As a result, we only focused on unregularized and regularized logistic regression. We evaluated the classification results using the area under the ROC curve and misclassification accuracy as metrics. From these results we were able to establish correlations between our computational feature set and radiological observations. 

Our approach can be used to evaluate the predictive value of computational features as well as to determine radiological observations that are difficult to predict from computational image features. While computational analysis is not likely to replace the trained eyes of a radiologist, this work can be used to develop decision support tools to increase accuracy and efficiency of radiological diagnosis.
