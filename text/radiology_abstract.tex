In this chapter I provide background into the problems and current solutions to decision support in radiological reporting. I begin by describing the clinical applications that I study throughout this text: liver imaging and breast imaging. I then describe some of the large issues in clinical radiology with respect to these domains. Finally, I describe decision support systems within these two domains, their contributions to the field, and shortcomings that I address in my work.
