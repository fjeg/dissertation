This dissertation contains work that is impactful both in clinical practice and in decision support. My results reveal how current reporting practices can lead to errors in diagnosis and should influence how reporting is done. The results also show to deliver decision support in radiology.

\subsection{Improving radiological performance by improving reports}
Though report quality is absolutely necessary for communication, my work is the first to show that low quality reporting is correlated with errors in diagnostic performance. I show how deficiencies in correctness, completeness and consistency of information in the radiological report lead to errors in the radiologist's final assessment. These results should be driving point to further investigate and measure quality of radiological reports in a systemic fashion.
