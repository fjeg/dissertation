This work improves upon existing clinical decision support systems through a novel approach to positively impact physician practice. The classic ``greek oracle'' model of decision support is ineffective, and does not improve upon the \emph{process} of delivering care. We identify that the optimal opportunity to deliver care is during radiology reporting. We then use this window to improve the physician's performance, which in turn, reduces error and variability in clinical practice.

\subsubsection{Information content in structured reports can be inferred from images}
This work shows that much of the information content in reports can directly be inferred from images. That being said, there are still semantic terms that we cannot easily predict, enforcing the concept of a \emph{semantic gap} between image information and human interpretation. We can guide future development of structured information to reduce this gap and help make interpretation more automated.

\subsubsection{Radiologist error is correlated with incomplete reports}
I have shown that radiologists who make errors in report interpretation also are more likely to have incomplete reports. Such a link shows that reports reflect the radiologist state of mind when interpreting images and offer a window for decision-support.
