abstract = {Since 1990, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has screened more than 60,000 compounds against a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines. The 50-percent growth-inhibitory concentration (GI50) for any single cell line is simply an index of cytotoxicity or cytostasis, but the patterns of 60 such GI50 values encode unexpectedly rich, detailed information on mechanisms of drug action and drug resistance. Each compound's pattern is like a fingerprint, essentially unique among the many billions of distinguishable possibilities. These activity patterns are being used in conjunction with molecular structural features of the tested agents to explore the NCI's database of more than 460,000 compounds, and they are providing insight into potential target molecules and modulators of activity in the 60 cell lines. For example, the information is being used to search for candidate anticancer drugs that are not dependent on intact p53 suppressor gene function for their activity. It remains to be seen how effective this information-intensive strategy will be at generating new clinically active agents.},

abstract = {Establishing quantitative relationships between molecular structure and broad biological effects has been a longstanding challenge in science. Currently, no method exists for forecasting broad biological activity profiles of medicinal agents even within narrow boundaries of structurally similar molecules. Starting from the premise that biological activity results from the capacity of small organic molecules to modulate the activity of the proteome, we set out to investigate whether descriptor sets could be developed for measuring and quantifying this molecular property. Using a 1,567-compound database, we show that percent inhibition values, determined at single high drug concentration in a battery of in vitro assays representing a cross section of the proteome, provide precise molecular property descriptors that identify the structure of molecules. When broad biological activity of molecules is represented in spectra form, organic molecules can be sorted by quantifying differences between biological spectra. Unlike traditional structure--activity relationship methods, sorting of molecules by using biospectra comparisons does not require knowledge of a molecule's putative drug targets. To illustrate this finding, we selected as starting point the biological activity spectra of clotrimazole and tioconazole because their putative target, lanosterol demethylase (CYP51), was not included in the bioassay array. Spectra similarity obtained through profile similarity measurements and hierarchical clustering provided an unbiased means for establishing quantitative relationships between chemical structures and biological activity spectra. This methodology, which we have termed biological spectra analysis, provides the capability not only of sorting molecules on the basis of biospectra similarity but also of predicting simultaneous interactions of new molecules with multiple proteins.},

Following these analyses, and with the recent rise of protein interaction measurements in mammals, protein networks are increasingly serving as tools to unravel the molecular basis of disease. We review promising applications of protein networks to disease in four major areas: identifying new disease genes; the study of their network properties; identifying disease-related subnetworks; and network-based disease classification. Applications in infectious disease, personalized medicine, and pharmacology are also forthcoming as the available protein network information improves in quality and coverage.},

abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Protein biomarkers in the blood are urgently needed for the diagnosis of a wide variety of diseases to improve health care. We aim to find a fast and cost-effective strategy to discover diagnostic protein biomarkers. Hundreds of diseases have already been investigated using microarray technology, measuring the mRNA expression of all genes in the disease-damaged tissues. We analyzed biopsy-based microarray data for 41 diseases in the public repository, identified genes with dysregulated mRNA expressions and detectable-protein abundance in the blood, and predicted them as candidate diagnostic protein biomarkers. We found that clinically and preclinically validated diagnostic protein biomarkers were significantly enriched in our predicted protein candidates for 22 diseases. We then measured the concentrations of ten predicted protein biomarkers in the serum samples from 39 renal transplant patients. Three of them were confirmed to be diagnostic of acute rejection after renal transplantation. All three proteins were further confirmed to be diagnostic of acute rejection in 63 cardiac transplant recipients. Our results show that publically available genome-wide gene expression data on disease-damaged tissues can be effectively translated into diagnostic protein biomarkers.</p>},

abstract = {Identifying the genes responsible for human diseases requires combining information about gene position with clues about biological function. The recent availability of whole-genome data sets of RNA and protein expression provides powerful new sources of functional insight. Here we illustrate how such data sets can expedite disease-gene discovery, by using them to identify the gene causing Leigh syndrome, French-Canadian type (LSFC, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man no. 220111), a human cytochrome c oxidase deficiency that maps to chromosome 2p16-21. Using four public RNA expression data sets, we assigned to all human genes a ``score'' reflecting their similarity in RNA-expression profiles to known mitochondrial genes. Using a large survey of organellar proteomics, we similarly classified human genes according to the likelihood of their protein product being associated with the mitochondrion. By intersecting this information with the relevant genomic region, we identified a single clear candidate gene, LRPPRC. Resequencing identified two mutations on two independent haplotypes, providing definitive genetic proof that LRPPRC indeed causes LSFC. LRPPRC encodes an mRNA-binding protein likely involved with mtDNA transcript processing, suggesting an additional mechanism of mitochondrial pathophysiology. Similar strategies to integrate diverse genomic information can be applied likewise to other disease pathways and will become increasingly powerful with the growing wealth of diverse, functional genomics data.},

abstract = {Motivation: Genome-wide experiments only rarely show resounding success in yielding genes associated with complex polygenic disorders. We evaluate 49 obesity-related genome-wide experiments with publicly available findings including microarray, genetics, proteomics and gene knock-down from human, mouse, rat and worm, in terms of their ability to rediscover a comprehensive set of genes previously found to be causally associated or having variants associated with obesity.Results: Individual experiments show poor predictive ability for rediscovering known obesity-associated genes. We show that intersecting the results of experiments significantly improves the sensitivity, specificity and precision of the prediction of obesity-associated genes. We create an integrative model that statistically significantly outperforms all 49 individual genome-wide experiments. We find that genes known to be associated with obesity are significantly implicated in more obesity-related experiments and use this to provide a list of genes that we predict to have the highest likelihood of association for obesity. The approach described here can include any number and type of genome-wide experiments and might be useful for other complex polygenic disorders as well.Contact: abutte@stanford.eduSupplementary information: Available online and at http://buttelab.stanford.edu/doku.php?id=public:obesityintegration},

abstract = {Storing and retrieving radiology cases is an important activity for education and clinical research, but this process can be time-consuming. In the process of structuring reports and images into organized teaching files, incidental pathologic conditions not pertinent to the primary teaching point can be omitted, as when a user saves images of an aortic dissection case but disregards the incidental osteoid osteoma. An alternate strategy for identifying teaching cases is text search of reports in radiology information systems (RIS), but retrieved reports are unstructured, teaching-related content is not highlighted, and patient identifying information is not removed. Furthermore, searching unstructured reports requires sophisticated retrieval methods to achieve useful results. An open-source, RadLex({\textregistered})-compatible teaching file solution called RADTF, which uses natural language processing (NLP) methods to process radiology reports, was developed to create a searchable teaching resource from the RIS and the picture archiving and communication system (PACS). The NLP system extracts and de-identifies teaching-relevant statements from full reports to generate a stand-alone database, thus converting existing RIS archives into an on-demand source of teaching material. Using RADTF, the authors generated a semantic search-enabled, Web-based radiology archive containing over 700,000 cases with millions of images. RADTF combines a compact representation of the teaching-relevant content in radiology reports and a versatile search engine with the scale of the entire RIS-PACS collection of case material.},

abstract = {Study Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of a computeraided consultation service using academic general internists and the Quick Medical Reference (QMR) diagnostic program; and to study the impact of the consultation on the diagnostic behavior of physicians caring for patients.Design: Prospective study of the diagnostic accuracy of computer-aided consultation in 31 cases, as well as a prospective study of ward team diagnoses and opinions before and after consultation.Setting: General medicine wards of two tertiary care centers.Participants: Thirty-one patients identified as posing a diagnostic challenge and meeting eligibility criteria, as well as the housestaff caring for these patients.Measurements and Main Results: After 6 months follow-up, diagnoses were established in 20 of 31 cases. The diagnostic sensitivity of the computer-assisted diagnoses, 85% (95% CI, 56% to 97%), was similar to that of the consult service physicians, 80% (95% CI, 55% to 94%), but better than that of the ward teams, 60% (95% CI, 33% to 81%; P = 0.03 using the binomial test). The consultation influenced the postconsultation differential diagnoses of the ward teams in 26 of the 31 cases (95% CI, 62% to 95%). House officers rated the consultation service as being educationally helpful in 25 of the 31 cases (95% CI, 62% to 94%).Conclusions: Computer-aided diagnostic consultation, when provided by physicians familiar with the limitations of the system and capable of overriding inappropriate suggestions, was both accurate and educationally helpful in most cases. The system provided reasonable diagnostic suggestions not previously considered by the ward teams and these suggestions were valued sufficiently to cause alteration of the original differential diagnoses.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:To develop a system to facilitate the retrieval of radiologic images that contain similar-appearing lesions and to perform a preliminary evaluation of this system with a database of computed tomographic (CT) images of the liver and an external standard of image similarity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Institutional review board approval was obtained for retrospective analysis of deidentified patient images. Thereafter, 30 portal venous phase CT images of the liver exhibiting one of three types of liver lesions (13 cysts, seven hemangiomas, 10 metastases) were selected. A radiologist used a controlled lexicon and a tool developed for complete and standardized description of lesions to identify and annotate each lesion with semantic features. In addition, this software automatically computed image features on the basis of image texture and boundary sharpness. Semantic and computer-generated features were weighted and combined into a feature vector representing each image. An independent reference standard was created for pairwise image similarity. This was used in a leave-one-out cross-validation to train weights that optimized the rankings of images in the database in terms of similarity to query images. Performance was evaluated by using precision-recall curves and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG), a common measure for the usefulness of information retrieval.

RESULTS:When used individually, groups of semantic, texture, and boundary features resulted in various levels of performance in retrieving relevant lesions. However, combining all features produced the best overall results. Mean precision was greater than 90% at all values of recall, and mean, best, and worst case retrieval accuracy was greater than 95%, 100%, and greater than 78%, respectively, with NDCG.

CONCLUSION:Preliminary assessment of this approach shows excellent retrieval results for three types of liver lesions visible on portal venous CT images, warranting continued development and validation in a larger and more comprehensive database.},

Existing classification schemes, however, are limited by coarse category scales. In addition, subjectivity can lead to sizeable interobserver and intraobserver variations. Here, we propose an interactive thresholding technique applied to digitized film-screen mammograms, which assesses the proportion of the mammographic image representing radiographically dense tissue. Observers viewed images on a CRT display and selected grey-level thresholds from which the breast and regions of dense tissue in the breast were identified. The proportion of radiographic density was then calculated from the image histogram. The technique was evaluated for the mammograms of 30 women and is well correlated (R > 0.91, Spearman coefficient) with a six-category subjective classification of radiographic density by radiologists. The technique was found to be very reliable with an intraclass correlation coefficient between observers typically R > 0.9. This technique may have a role in routine mammographic analysis for the purpose of assessing risk categories and as a tool in studies of the etiology of breast cancer, in particular for monitoring changes in breast parenchyma during potential preventive interventions.},

To address several limitations of subjective classification of mammographic parenchyma into coarse density categories, we have been investigating more quantitative, objective methods of analysing the film-screen mammogram. These include measures of the skewness of the image brightness histogram, and of image texture characterized by the fractal dimension. Both measures were found to be strongly correlated with radiologists' subjective classifications of mammographic parenchyma (Spearman correlation coefficients, Rs = -0.88 and -0.76 for skewness and fractal dimension measurements, respectively). Further, neither measure was strongly dependent on simulated changes in mammographic technique. Correlation with subjective classification of mammographic density was better when both the skewness and fractal measures were used in combination than when either was used alone. This suggests that each feature provides some independent information.},

abstract = {Background: Despite increasing emphasis on the role of clinical decision-support systems (CDSSs) for improving care and reducing costs, evidence to support widespread use is lacking.Purpose: To evaluate the effect of CDSSs on clinical outcomes, health care processes, workload and efficiency, patient satisfaction, cost, and provider use and implementation.Data Sources: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science through January 2011.Study Selection: Investigators independently screened reports to identify randomized trials published in English of electronic CDSSs that were implemented in clinical settings; used by providers to aid decision making at the point of care; and reported clinical, health care process, workload, relationship-centered, economic, or provider use outcomes.Data Extraction: Investigators extracted data about study design, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and quality.Data Synthesis: 148 randomized, controlled trials were included. A total of 128 (86%) assessed health care process measures, 29 (20%) assessed clinical outcomes, and 22 (15%) measured costs. Both commercially and locally developed CDSSs improved health care process measures related to performing preventive services (n = 25; odds ratio [OR], 1.42 [95% CI, 1.27 to 1.58]), ordering clinical studies (n = 20; OR, 1.72 [CI, 1.47 to 2.00]), and prescribing therapies (n = 46; OR, 1.57 [CI, 1.35 to 1.82]). Few studies measured potential unintended consequences or adverse effects.Limitations: Studies were heterogeneous in interventions, populations, settings, and outcomes. Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be excluded.Conclusion: Both commercially and locally developed CDSSs are effective at improving health care process measures across diverse settings, but evidence for clinical, economic, workload, and efficiency outcomes remains sparse. This review expands knowledge in the field by demonstrating the benefits of CDSSs outside of experienced academic centers.Primary Funding Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.},

The purpose of our study was to determine the specificity of helical CT for depiction of hepatocellular carcinoma in a population of patients with cirrhosis.SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Single-detector helical CT screening was undertaken in 1329 patients with cirrhosis who were referred for transplantation. The patients underwent one or more helical CT examinations over 30 months and were followed up for an additional 19 months or until transplantation. We predominantly used unenhanced and biphasic contrast-enhanced techniques with infusions of 2.5--5.0 mL/sec. Four hundred thirty patients underwent transplantation within this period. Liver specimens were sectioned at 1-cm intervals, with direct comparison of imaging and pathologic findings and histologic confirmations of all lesions. Prospective preoperative helical CT reports were used for the primary data analysis. A retrospective unblinded review was undertaken to determine characteristics of false-positive lesions diagnosed as hepatocellular carci...},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Cellular processes cause changes over time. Observing and measuring those changes over time allows insights into the how and why of regulation. The experimental platform for doing the appropriate large-scale experiments to obtain time-courses of expression levels is provided by microarray technology. However, the proper way of analyzing the resulting time course data is still very much an issue under investigation. The inherent time dependencies in the data suggest that clustering techniques which reflect those dependencies yield improved performance. RESULTS: We propose to use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to account for the horizontal dependencies along the time axis in time course data and to cope with the prevalent errors and missing values. The HMMs are used within a model-based clustering framework. We are given a number of clusters, each represented by one Hidden Markov Model from a finite collection encompassing typical qualitative behavior. Then, our method finds in an iterative procedure cluster models and an assignment of data points to these models that maximizes the joint likelihood of clustering and models. Partially supervised learning--adding groups of labeled data to the initial collection of clusters--is supported. A graphical user interface allows querying an expression profile dataset for time course similar to a prototype graphically defined as a sequence of levels and durations. We also propose a heuristic approach to automate determination of the number of clusters. We evaluate the method on published yeast cell cycle and fibroblasts serum response datasets, and compare them, with favorable results, to the autoregressive curves method.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Depression is associated with interpersonal difficulties related to abnormalities in affective facial processing.

OBJECTIVES:To map brain systems activated by sad facial affect processing in patients with depression and to identify brain functional correlates of antidepressant treatment and symptomatic response.

DESIGN:Two groups underwent scanning twice using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an 8-week period. The event-related fMRI paradigm entailed incidental affect recognition of facial stimuli morphed to express discriminable intensities of sadness.

SETTING:Participants were recruited by advertisement from the local population; depressed subjects were treated as outpatients.

PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS:We matched 19 medication-free, acutely symptomatic patients satisfying DSM-IV criteria for unipolar major depressive disorder by age, sex, and IQ with 19 healthy volunteers. Intervention After the baseline assessment, patients received fluoxetine hydrochloride, 20 mg/d, for 8 weeks.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Average activation (capacity) and differential response to variable affective intensity (dynamic range) were estimated in each fMRI time series. We used analysis of variance to identify brain regions that demonstrated a main effect of group (depressed vs healthy subjects) and a group x time interaction (attributable to antidepressant treatment). Change in brain activation associated with reduction of depressive symptoms in the patient group was identified by means of regression analysis. Permutation tests were used for inference.

RESULTS:Over time, depressed subjects showed reduced capacity for activation in the left amygdala, ventral striatum, and frontoparietal cortex and a negatively correlated increase of dynamic range in the prefrontal cortex. Symptomatic improvement was associated with reduction of dynamic range in the pregenual cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, and cerebellum.

CONCLUSIONS:Antidepressant treatment reduces left limbic, subcortical, and neocortical capacity for activation in depressed subjects and increases the dynamic range of the left prefrontal cortex. Changes in anterior cingulate function associated with symptomatic improvement indicate that fMRI may be a useful surrogate marker of antidepressant treatment response.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Some patients with low-grade glioma have extraordinarily long survival times; current, early treatment does not prolong their lives. For this reason, therapies that sometimes have neurologic side effects are often deferred intentionally.

METHODS:In a study of oligodendrogliomas, we used a quantitative method of MR analysis based on the S-transform to investigate whether codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q, a marker of good prognosis, could be predicted accurately by measuring image texture.

RESULTS:Differences in texture were seen between tumors with codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q and those with intact 1p and 19q alleles on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR images. Quantitative MR texture on T2 images predicted codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q with high sensitivity and specificity.

CONCLUSIONS:This new method of MR image interpretation may have the potential to augment the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected low-grade glioma.},

abstract = {Determining the frequency content of a signal is a basic operation in signal and image processing. The S-transform provides both the true frequency and globally referenced phase measurements characteristic of the Fourier transform and also generates local spectra, as does the wavelet transform. Due to this combination, the S-transform has been successfully demonstrated in a variety of biomedical signal and image processing tasks. However, the computational demands of the S-transform have limited its application in medicine to this point in time. This abstract introduces the fast S-transform, a more efficient discrete implementation of the classic S-transform with dramatically reduced computational requirements.},

abstract = {Improvements in CT technology have dramatically increased our ability to detect and diagnose liver abnormalities, particularly neoplastic disease. Because of the high prevalence of liver disease in patients referred for abdominal CT examinations, contrast administration and scanning techniques are usually optimized for detection of liver disease on abdominal CT scans. A wide variety of contrast techniques can be used to evaluate the liver, and it is important to understand both the rationale behind each technique and the impact on the quality of the examination when one deviates from these techniques. In addition, the timing of contrast administration and scan acquisition has become critical, and improper timing can cause lesions that are easily visualized to be obscured. This article reviews principles of lesion detection and the effects of various contrast techniques on lesion visualization.},

abstract = {The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is based on imaging examinations in combination with clinical and laboratory findings. Despite technological advances, imaging cirrhotic patients remains a challenging issue because nonmalignant hepatocellular lesions, such as dysplastic nodules, mimic a small HCC. One of the key pathologic factors for differential diagnosis that is reflected in imaging appearances is the vascular supply to the lesion. It is accepted that imaging techniques may establish the diagnosis of HCC in nodules larger than 2 cm showing characteristic arterial hypervascularization. In lesions ranging from 1 to 2 cm, biopsy is still recommended, although a negative response can never be used to rule out malignancy completely. Although ultrasonography is widely accepted for HCC surveillance, spiral computed tomography (CT) or dynamic magnetic resonance imaging is required for diagnostic confirmation and intrahepatic tumor staging. These examinations have replaced invasive procedures, such as lipiodol CT, but remain relatively insensitive for the detection of tiny HCC lesions and tumor vascular invasion into peripheral portal vein branches.},

Information schemes are being developed to describe the semantic content of images, but such schemes can be unwieldy to operationalize because there are few tools to enable users to capture structured information easily as part of the routine research workflow. We have created iPad, an open source tool enabling researchers and clinicians to create semantic annotations on radiological images. iPad hides the complexity of the underlying image annotation information model from users, permitting them to describe images and image regions using a graphical interface that maps their descriptions to structured ontologies semi-automatically. Image annotations are saved in a variety of formats,enabling interoperability among medical records systems, image archives in hospitals, and the Semantic Web. Tools such as iPad can help reduce the burden of collecting structured information from images, and it could ultimately enable researchers and physicians to exploit images on a very large scale and glean the biological and physiological significance of image content.},

Until the early 1990s, HCC was a relatively rare malignancy, typically diagnosed at an advanced stage in a symptomatic patient, and there were no known effective palliative or therapeutic options. However, the rising incidence of HCC in several regions around the world coupled with emerging evidence for efficacy of screening in high-risk patients, liver transplantation as a curative option in select patients, ability to make definitive diagnosis using high-resolution imaging of the liver, less dependency on obtaining tissue diagnosis, and proven efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization and sorafenib as palliative therapy have improved the outlook for HCC patients. In this article, we present a summary of the most recent information on screening, diagnosis, staging, and different treatment modalities of HCC, as well as our recommended management approach.},

abstract = {For shapes represented as closed planar contours, we introduce a class of functionals which are invariant with respect to the Euclidean group and which are obtained by performing integral operations. While such integral invariants enjoy some of the desirable properties of their differential counterparts, such as locality of computation (which allows matching under occlusions) and uniqueness of representation (asymptotically), they do not exhibit the noise sensitivity associated with differential quantities and, therefore, do not require presmoothing of the input shape. Our formulation allows the analysis of shapes at multiple scales. Based on integral invariants, we define a notion of distance between shapes. The proposed distance measure can be computed efficiently and allows warping the shape boundaries onto each other; its computation results in optimal point correspondence as an intermediate step. Numerical results on shape matching demonstrate that this framework can match shapes despite the deformation of subparts, missing parts and noise. As a quantitative analysis, we report matching scores for shape retrieval from a database.},

abstract = {A multidimensional image navigation and display software was designed for display and interpretation of large sets of multidimensional and multimodality images such as combined PET-CT studies. The software is developed in Objective-C on a Macintosh platform under the MacOS X operating system using the GNUstep development environment. It also benefits from the extremely fast and optimized 3D graphic capabilities of the OpenGL graphic standard widely used for computer games optimized for taking advantage of any hardware graphic accelerator boards available. In the design of the software special attention was given to adapt the user interface to the specific and complex tasks of navigating through large sets of image data. An interactive jog-wheel device widely used in the video and movie industry was implemented to allow users to navigate in the different dimensions of an image set much faster than with a traditional mouse or on-screen cursors and sliders. The program can easily be adapted for very specific tasks that require a limited number of functions, by adding and removing tools from the program's toolbar and avoiding an overwhelming number of unnecessary tools and functions. The processing and image rendering tools of the software are based on the open-source libraries ITK and VTK. This ensures that all new developments in image processing that could emerge from other academic institutions using these libraries can be directly ported to the OsiriX program.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study reviews the evidence for the effectiveness of computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) in cancer imaging. Diagnostic applications were studied to estimate the impact of CAD on radiologists' detection and diagnosis of cancer lesions. METHODS: Online databases were searched and 48 studies from 1992 to 2010 were included: 16 with radiologists using CAD to detect lesions (CADe) and 32 with radiologists using CAD to classify or diagnose lesions (CADx). Weighted means, statistics, summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) curves, and related measures were used for analysis. RESULTS: There is evidence that CADx significantly improves diagnosis in mammography and breast ultrasound. In contrast, studies of CADx applied to lung CT and dermatologic imaging show an adverse impact on diagnosis. Overall, there is no evidence of a benefit due to the use of CADe. The area under the SROC curves was not significantly increased for radiologists using either CADe or CADx. CONCLUSIONS: From this analysis it seems CADx can offer some benefit to radiologists in specific imaging applications for breast cancer diagnosis. There is no evidence of a beneficial effect in other applications of CAD and some evidence of a detrimental one.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe three emerging computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems induced by Japanese health care needs. CAD has been developing fast in the last two decades. The idea of using a computer to help in medical image diagnosis is not new. Some pioneer studies are dated back to the 1960s. In 1998, the first U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved commercial CAD system, a film-digitized mammography system, was launched by R2 Technologies, Inc. The success was quickly repeated by a number of companies. The approval of Medicare CAD reimbursement in the U.S. in 2001 further boosted the industry. Today, CAD has its significance in the economy of the medical industry. FDA approved CAD products in the field of breast imaging (mammography, ultrasonography and breast MRI) and chest imaging (radiography and CT) can be seen. In Japan, as part of the "Knowledge Cluster Initiative" of the government, three computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) projects are hosted at the Gifu University since 2004. These projects are regarding the development of CAD systems for the early detection of (1) cerebrovascular diseases using brain MRI and MRA images by detecting lacunar infarcts, unruptured aneurysms, and arterial occlusions; (2) ocular diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and hypertensive retinopathy using retinal fundus images; and (3) breast cancers using ultrasound 3-D volumetric whole breast data by detecting the breast masses. The projects are entering their final development stage. Preliminary results are presented in this paper. Clinical examinations will be started soon, and commercialized CAD systems for the above subjects will appear by the completion of this project.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:The purpose of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of 3.0-T breast MRI interpretation using manual and fully automated kinetic analyses.

MATERIAL AND METHODS:Manual MRI interpretation was done on an Advantage Workstation. Retrospectively, all examinations were processed with a computer-aided detection (CAD) system. CAD data sets were interpreted by two experienced breast radiologists and two residents. For each lesion automated analysis of enhancement kinetics was evaluated at 50% and 100% thresholds. Forty-nine malignant and 22 benign lesions were evaluated.

RESULTS:Using threshold enhancement alone, the sensitivity and specificity of CAD were 97.9% and 86.4%, respectively, for the 50% threshold, and 97.9% and 90%, respectively, for the 100% threshold. Manual interpretation by two breast radiologists showed a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 68.8%. For the same two radiologists the mean sensitivity and specificity for CAD-based interpretation was 90.4% (not significant) and 81.3% (significant at p < 0.05), respectively. With one-way ANOVA no significant differences were found between the two breast radiologists and the two residents together, or between any two readers separately.

CONCLUSION:CAD-based analysis improved the specificity compared with manual analysis of enhancement. Automated analysis at 50% and 100% thresholds showed a high sensitivity and specificity for readers with varying levels of experience.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:The American College of Radiology has recommended the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) as a standardized scheme for describing mammographic lesions. The objective of this study was to measure inter- and intraobserver variabilities of radiologists' descriptions of mammographic lesions with the BI-RADS standardized lexicon.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Sixty mammographic studies with abnormal findings were independently evaluated by five radiologists. Readers described each lesion by selecting a single term from the BI-RADS lexicon for each of eight morphologic categories: calcification distribution, number, and description; mass margin, shape, and density; associated findings; and special cases. Additionally, each reader assessed the significance of each lesion on a five-point scale. One observer read each case twice. Inter- and intraobserver variabilities for each description and interpretation category of the BI-RADS lexicon were determined with Cohen's kappa statistic. Radiologists' specific use of calcification descriptors was evaluated in detail.

RESULTS:Substantial agreement was observed between readers for choosing terms to describe masses and calcifications (kappa value range, 0.50 +/- 0.02-0.77 +/- 0.03). Intraobserver agreement for these categories was similar (kappa value range, 0.57 +/- 0.07-0.84 +/- 0.09). Considerable inter- and intraobserver variabilities were noted for the "associated findings" and "special cases" categories (kappa value range, -0.02 +/- 0.14-0.38 +/- 0.12), a result that in part reflected the small number of cases to which these categories were assigned. Moderate interobserver variability and little intraobserver variability in the interpretation of lesion significance were noted when an assessment classification similar to that of BI-RADS was used. Use of terms to describe calcifications did not always conform to BI-RADS-defined levels of suspicion.

CONCLUSION:BI-RADS is moderately successful in providing a standardized language for physicians to describe lesion morphology. Efforts to reevaluate specific terms and the diagnostic significance assigned to calcification descriptors may prove useful in maintaining the promise of improved quality with the BI-RADS standardized mammography lexicon.},

An important component of the BI-RADS initiative is the lexicon, a dictionary of descriptors of specific imaging features. The BI-RADS lexicon has always been data driven, using descriptors that previously had been shown in the literature to be predictive of benign and malignant disease. Once established, the BI-RADS lexicon provided new opportunities for quality assurance, communication, research, and improved patient care. The history of this lexicon illustrates a series of challenges and instructive successes that provide a valuable guide for other groups that aspire to develop similar lexicons in the future.},

abstract = {Qualitative expressions of probability, such as "likely," have different numerical meanings to different people, which can lead to misunderstanding among physicians and between physicians and patients. In a study conducted through a nationwide interactive computer network based at Massachusetts General Hospital, we gathered information on the meaning of common expressions of probability. Three groups of medical professionals assigned percentage values to 12 expressions of the probability that a given symptom would appear in a patient with an unspecified disease. The median values assigned to these expressions by physicians, medical students, and other professionals were almost the same. Comparisons of the means for 7 of these 12 expressions with those found in an earlier study by other investigators showed that they were quantified in the same order, although they had not been assigned the same numerical values. This degree of agreement among professionals and between studies is encouraging for the future prospects of codifying the meaning of such expressions. The variation among five studies in the mean values assigned to 37 expressions in the medical literature and the variation among individual opinions show that such codification is necessary. In the meantime, the average numerical values presented here for various qualitative expressions of probability could well be used to enhance communication among medical professionals.},

abstract = {Background:  Trials have shown that mammography screening reduces mortality and probably decreases morbidity related to breast cancer. Methods:  We assessed whether the major mammography service in Western Australia (BreastScreen WA) is likely to reduce mortality by comparing prognostic variables between screen-detected and other cases of breast cancer diagnosed in 1999. We assessed likely reductions in morbidity by comparing treatments received by these two groups. To confirm mortality and morbidity reduction, we also compared prognostic variables and treatments with targets. Information on demographic variables, tumour characteristics at presentation and treatments were collected from medical records for all incident cases of breast cancer in Western Australia in 1999. We matched cases with the Western Australian Cancer Registry records to determine which cases had been detected by BreastScreen WA. Results:  BreastScreen WA achieved the targets for mortality reduction. Tumours detected by BreastScreen WA were smaller in size, less likely to have vascular invasion, of lower histological grade and were more likely to be ductal carcinoma in situ alone without invasive carcinoma. Oestrogen receptor status was more likely to be positive, the difference in progesterone status was not significant, and lymph node involvement tended to be lower. BreastScreen WA patients were treated more often with local therapy and less often with systemic therapy, and the proportion of patients treated with breast-conserving surgery was close to the target for minimizing morbidity in breast cancer. Conclusion:  Mammographic detection of breast cancer by BreastScreen WA is associated with reduced breast cancer morbidity and a more favourable prognosis.},

The purpose of this study is to determine whether there were significant differences with respect to treatment recommendations, stage at diagnosis, and identification of high-risk lesions for women 40?49 years old undergoing screening mammography (screened) compared to women with a symptom needing a diagnostic evaluation (nonscreened). MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the pathology results of all imaging-guided biopsies performed at the three breast center locations of University Hospitals Case Medical Center from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2011. In patients diagnosed with a high-risk lesion or breast cancer, the reason for presentation, pathology, tumor size, stage, receptor characteristics, and treatment were recorded. The chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS. Of 230 primary breast cancers, 149 were in the screened group and 81 were considered nonscreened. Nonscreened patients were more likely to undergo chemotherapy (p = 0.042). Eighty-one percent of the high-risk lesions were diagnosed in the screened patients. Screened patients with cancer were significantly more likely to receive a diagnosis at earlier stages (p = 0.001), to have negative axillary lymph nodes (p = 0.005), and to have smaller tumors (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. In addition to the benefits of receiving a diagnosis at earlier stages, with smaller tumors and node negativity, patients with breast cancer undergoing screening mammography aged 40?49 years are less likely to require chemotherapy and its associated morbidities. The majority of high-risk lesions were diagnosed in the screened group, which may lead to the benefit of chemoprevention, lowering their risk of subsequent breast cancer, or screening with MRI, which may diagnose future mammographically occult malignancies.},

The purpose of this study was to compare breast cancer stage at diagnosis in two groups of women between 40 and 49 years old: women undergoing screening mammography and women with a symptom needing diagnostic workup. This comparison is indicative of the impact of forgoing screening in this age group, as recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective chart review was used to collect the results of imaging-guided core needle biopsies performed in women between the ages of 40 and 49 years from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2009. In patients diagnosed with breast cancer or a high-risk lesion, the reason for presentation, pathology, tumor size, stage, and receptor characteristics were recorded. The chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS. Of 108 primary breast cancers, 71 were detected in the screened group and 37 in the unscreened group. The screened group was significantly more likely to be diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ than the unscreened group (22 vs 1, chi-square = 11.6, p = 0.001). Furthermore, screened patients with invasive carcinoma were significantly more likely to be diagnosed at earlier stages (chi-square = 5.02, p = 0.025). The size of invasive breast cancer in the screened group was significantly smaller as well (chi-square = 9.3, p = 0.002). Of the high-risk lesions, atypical ductal hyperplasia (n = 29) and lobular carcinoma in situ (n = 8) were most frequently seen. CONCLUSION. Breast cancer patients undergoing screening mammography were diagnosed at earlier stages with smaller tumors. Screening also allows detection of high-risk lesions, which may prompt chemoprevention and lower subsequent breast cancer risk. We continue to support screening mammography in women between the ages of 40 and 49 years.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:The 2009 release of updated US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on screening mammography differed sharply from those of the American Cancer Society, the ACR, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The aim of this study was to ascertain the effect of these recommendations on the utilization of screening mammography in the Medicare population.

METHODS:The Medicare Part B Physician/Supplier Procedure Summary Master Files from 2005 through 2010 were used to determine the annual utilization rate of screening mammography from 2005 to 2010. A utilization trend line was plotted for those years.

RESULTS:The utilization rate of screening mammography per 1,000 women in the Medicare population was 311.6 in 2005 and increased gradually each year to 322.9 in 2009 (a compound annual growth rate of 0.9%). However, after the USPSTF recommendations were issued in late 2009, this rate decreased abruptly to 309.1 (-4.3%) in 2010.

CONCLUSIONS:The abrupt decrease in the utilization of screening mammography in 2010 was in sharp contrast to the previous slow annual increases in its utilization from 2005 to 2009. Because there are no other factors to explain a decrease of this magnitude, it would seem that the USPSTF recommendations and the ensuing publicity resulted in a decrease in the utilization of screening mammography in the Medicare population in the first year after issuance of the new recommendations.},

A longitudinal prospective cohort study was conducted of women aged 40?49 years who had primary breast cancer, during 1990?2008, and were identified and tracked by a dedicated registry database (n = 1977). Method of detection?patient detected (PtD), physician detected (PhysD), or mammography detected (MamD)?was chart abstracted. Disease-specific survival and relapse-free survival statistics were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method for stage I?IV breast cancer.ResultsA significant increase in the percentage of MamD breast cancer over time (28%?58%) and a concurrent decline in patient and physician detected (Pt/PhysD) breast cancer (73%?42%) (Pearson x2 = 72.72, P < .001) were observed over time from 1990 to 2008, with an overall increase in lower-stage disease detection and a decrease in higher-stage disease. MamD breast cancer patients were more likely to undergo lumpectomy (67% vs 48% of Pt/PhysD breast cancer patients) and less likely to undergo modified radical mastectomy (25% vs 47% of the Pt/PhysD breast cancer patients) (P < .001). Uncorrected for stage, 13% of MamD breast cancer patients underwent surgery and chemotherapy versus 22% of Pt/PhysD breast cancer patients (P < .001), and 31% of MamD breast cancer patients underwent surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy versus 59% of Pt/PhysD breast cancer patients (x2 = 305.13, P < .001). Analyzing invasive cancers only, 5-year relapse-free survival for MamD breast cancer patients was 92% versus 88% for Pt/PhysD patients (log-rank test, 12.47; P < .001).ConclusionIncreased mammography-detected breast cancer over time coincided with lower?stage disease detection resulting in reduced treatment and lower rates of recurrence, adding factors to consider when evaluating the benefits of mammography screening of women aged 40?49 years.?

abstract = {AbstractBackground There is concern about detection of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in screening mammography. DCIS accounts for a substantial proportion of screen-detected lesions but its effect on breast cancer mortality is debated. The International Cancer Screening Network conducted a comparative analysis to determine variation in DCIS detection. Patients and Methods Data were collected during 2004--2008 on number of screening examinations, detected breast cancers, DCIS cases and Globocan 2008 breast cancer incidence rates derived from national or regional cancer registers. We calculated screen-detection rates for breast cancers and DCIS. Results Data were obtained from 15 screening settings in 12 countries; 7,176,050 screening examinations; 29,605 breast cancers and 5324 DCIS cases. The ratio between highest and lowest breast cancer incidence was 2.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.76--3.00); 2.97 (95% CI 2.51--3.51) for detection of breast cancer; and 3.49 (95% CI 2.70--4.51) for detection of DCIS. Conclusions Considerable international variation was found in DCIS detection. This variation could not be fully explained by variation in incidence nor in breast cancer detection rates. It suggests the potential for wide discrepancies in management of DCIS resulting in overtreatment of indolent DCIS or undertreatment of potentially curable disease. Comprehensive cancer registration is needed to monitor DCIS detection. Efforts to understand discrepancies and standardise management may improve care.},

The principal research design was a "before and after" comparison at Hammersmith Hospital, as the hospital site introducing PACS. Several other hospitals were included in this survey, for comparison. Questionnaires were distributed several times before PACS was operational at Hammersmith, and on one occasion after. The overall response rate was 54%. The main pre-PACS radiology-related problem areas were: the non-availability of images, the non-availability of written reports when clinically required, and the time devoted by junior staff to image searching. PACS greatly reduced the perceived problem of image non-availability. But Hammersmith's problems with the availability of radiological reports still remained when PACS was operational. The time junior doctors spent in image-searching was dramatically reduced by the introduction of PACS.},

abstract = {Experts estimate that as many as 98,000 people die in any given year from medical errors that occur in hospitals. That{\&}{\#}039;s more than die from motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer, or AIDS--three causes that receive far more public attention. Indeed, more people die annually from medication errors than from workplace injuries. Add the financial cost to the human tragedy, and medical error easily rises to the top ranks of urgent, widespread public problems. To Err Is Human breaks the silence that has surrounded medical errors and their consequence--but not by pointing fingers at caring health care professionals who make honest mistakes. After all, to err is human. Instead, this book sets forth a national agenda--with state and local implications--for reducing medical errors and improving patient safety through the design of a safer health system. This volume reveals the often startling statistics of medical error and the disparity between the incidence of error and public perception of it, given many patients{\&}{\#}039; expectations that the medical profession always performs perfectly. A careful examination is made of how the surrounding forces of legislation, regulation, and market activity influence the quality of care provided by health care organizations and then looks at their handling of medical mistakes. Using a detailed case study, the book reviews the current understanding of why these mistakes happen. A key theme is that legitimate liability concerns discourage reporting of errors--which begs the question, {\&}quot;How can we learn from our mistakes?{\&}quot; Balancing regulatory versus market-based initiatives and public versus private efforts, the Institute of Medicine presents wide-ranging recommendations for improving patient safety, in the areas of leadership, improved data collection and analysis, and development of effective systems at the level of direct patient care. To Err Is Human asserts that the problem is not bad people in health care--it is that good people are working in bad systems that need to be made safer. Comprehensive and straightforward, this book offers a clear prescription for raising the level of patient safety in American health care. It also explains how patients themselves can influence the quality of care that they receive once they check into the hospital. This book will be vitally important to federal, state, and local health policy makers and regulators, health professional licensing officials, hospital administrators, medical educators and students, health caregivers, health journalists, patient advocates--as well as patients themselves.

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two types of real-time decision support, an interrupting pop-up alert and a noninterrupting dynamically annotated visualization (DAV), in reducing clinically inappropriate diagnostic imaging orders.Background: Alerts in electronic health record software are frequently disregarded due to high false-alarm rates, interruptions, and uncertainty about what triggered the alert. In other settings, providing visualizations and improving understandability of the guidance has been shown to improve overall decision making.Method: Using a between-subject design, we examined the effect of two forms of decision support, alerts and DAVs, on reducing the proportion of inappropriate diagnostic imaging orders for 11 patients in a simulated environment. Nine attending and 11 resident physicians with experience using an electronic health record were randomly assigned to the form of decision support. Secondary measures were self-reported understandability, algorithm transparency, and clinical relevance.Results: Fewer inappropriate diagnostic imaging tests were ordered with DAVs than with alerts (18% vs. 34%, p < .001). The DAV was rated higher for all three secondary measures (p < .001) for all participants.Conclusion: DAVs were more effective than alerts in reducing inappropriate imaging orders and were preferred for all patient scenarios, especially scenarios where guidance was ambiguous or based on inaccurate information.Application: Creating visualizations that are permanently displayed and vary in the strength of their guidance can mitigate the risk of system performance degradation due to incomplete or incorrect data. This interaction paradigm may be applicable for other settings with high false-alarm rates or where there is a need to reduce interruptions during decision making.},

abstract = {Mammography has been shown to improve outcomes of women with breast cancer, but it is subject to inter-reader variability. One well-documented source of such variability is in the content of mammography reports. The mammography report is of crucial importance, since it documents the radiologist's imaging observations, interpretation of those observations in terms of likelihood of malignancy, and suggested patient management. In this paper, we define an incompleteness score to measure how incomplete the information content is in the mammography report and provide an algorithm to calculate this metric. We then show that the incompleteness score can be used to predict errors in interpretation. This method has 82.6% accuracy at predicting errors in interpretation and can possibly reduce total diagnostic errors by up to 21.7%. Such a method can easily be modified to suit other domains that depend on quality reporting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Interpretive performance of screening mammography varies substantially by facility, but performance of diagnostic interpretation has not been studied.

METHODS:Facilities performing diagnostic mammography within three registries of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium were surveyed about their structure, organization, and interpretive processes. Performance measurements (false-positive rate, sensitivity, and likelihood of cancer among women referred for biopsy [positive predictive value of biopsy recommendation {PPV2}]) from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2005, were prospectively measured. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, adjusted for patient and radiologist characteristics, were used to assess the association between facility characteristics and interpretive performance. All statistical tests were two-sided.

RESULTS:Forty-five of the 53 facilities completed a facility survey (85% response rate), and 32 of the 45 facilities performed diagnostic mammography. The analyses included 28 100 diagnostic mammograms performed as an evaluation of a breast problem, and data were available for 118 radiologists who interpreted diagnostic mammograms at the facilities. Performance measurements demonstrated statistically significant interpretive variability among facilities (sensitivity, P = .006; false-positive rate, P < .001; and PPV2, P < .001) in unadjusted analyses. However, after adjustment for patient and radiologist characteristics, only false-positive rate variation remained statistically significant and facility traits associated with performance measures changed (false-positive rate = 6.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.5% to 7.4%; sensitivity = 73.5%, 95% CI = 67.1% to 79.9%; and PPV2 = 33.8%, 95% CI = 29.1% to 38.5%). Facilities reporting that concern about malpractice had moderately or greatly increased diagnostic examination recommendations at the facility had a higher false-positive rate (odds ratio [OR] = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.09 to 2.01) and a non-statistically significantly higher sensitivity (OR = 1.74, 95% CI = 0.94 to 3.23). Facilities offering specialized interventional services had a non-statistically significantly higher false-positive rate (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 0.94 to 4.1). No characteristics were associated with overall accuracy by ROC curve analyses.

CONCLUSIONS:Variation in diagnostic mammography interpretation exists across facilities. Failure to adjust for patient characteristics when comparing facility performance could lead to erroneous conclusions. Malpractice concerns are associated with interpretive performance.},

abstract = {Purpose: To identify radiologists' characteristics associated with interpretive performance in screening mammography.Materials and Methods: The study was approved by institutional review boards of University of Washington (Seattle, Wash) and institutions at seven Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium sites, informed consent was obtained, and procedures were HIPAA compliant. Radiologists who interpreted mammograms in seven U.S. regions completed a self-administered mailed survey; information on demographics, practice type, and experience in and perceptions of general radiology and breast imaging was collected. Survey data were linked to data on screening mammograms the radiologists interpreted between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2005, and included patient risk factors, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System assessment, and follow-up breast cancer data. The survey was returned by 71% (257 of 364) of radiologists; in 56% (205 of 364) of the eligible radiologists, complete data on screening mammograms during the study period were provided; these data were used in the final analysis. An evaluation of whether the radiologists' characteristics were associated with recall rate, false-positive rate, sensitivity, or positive predictive value of recall (PPV1) of the screening examinations was performed with logistic regression models that were adjusted for patients' characteristics and radiologist-specific random effects.Results: Study radiologists interpreted 1 036 155 screening mammograms; 4961 breast cancers were detected. Median percentages and interquartile ranges, respectively, were as follows: recall rate, 9.3% and 6.3%--13.2%; false-positive rate, 8.9% and 5.9%--12.8%; sensitivity, 83.8% and 74.5%--92.3%; and PPV1, 4.0% and 2.6%--5.9%. Wide variability in sensitivity was noted, even among radiologists with similar false-positive rates. In adjusted regression models, female radiologists or fellowship-trained radiologists had significantly higher recall and false-positive rates (P < .05, all). Fellowship training in breast imaging was the only characteristic significantly associated with improved sensitivity (odds ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.42, 3.80; P < .001) and the overall accuracy parameter (odds ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.05, 2.45; P = .028).Conclusion: Fellowship training in breast imaging may lead to improved cancer detection, but it is associated with higher false-positive rates.{\copyright} RSNA, 2009},

abstract = {Background: Precise quantification of overdiagnosis of breast cancer (defined as the percentage of cases of cancer that would not have become clinically apparent in a woman's lifetime without screening) due to mammography screening has been hampered by lack of valid comparison groups that identify incidence trends attributable to screening versus those due to temporal trends in incidence.Objective: To estimate the percentage of overdiagnosis of breast cancer attributable to mammography screening.Design: Comparison of invasive breast cancer incidence with and without screening.Setting: A nationwide mammography screening program in Norway (inviting women aged 50 to 69 years), gradually implemented from 1996 to 2005.Participants: The Norwegian female population.Measurements: Concomitant incidence of invasive breast cancer from 1996 to 2005 in counties where the screening program was implemented compared with that in counties where the program was not yet implemented. To adjust for changes in temporal trends in breast cancer incidence, incidence rates during the preceding decade were also examined. The percentage of overdiagnosis was calculated by accounting for the expected decrease in incidence following cessation of screening after age 69 years (approach 1) and by comparing incidence in the current screening group with incidence among women 2 and 5 years older in the historical screening groups, accounting for average lead time (approach 2).Results: A total of 39 888 patients with invasive breast cancer were included, 7793 of whom were diagnosed after the screening program started. The estimated rate of overdiagnosis attributable to the program was 18% to 25% (P < 0.001) for approach 1 and 15% to 20% (P < 0.001) for approach 2. Thus, 15% to 25% of cases of cancer are overdiagnosed, translating to 6 to 10 women overdiagnosed for every 2500 women invited.Limitation: The study was registry-based.Conclusion: Mammography screening entails a substantial amount of overdiagnosis.Primary Funding Source: Norwegian Research Council and Frontier Science.},

Existing approaches to ensuring the validity of inferences drawn from data assume a fixed procedure to be performed, selected before the data are examined. In common practice, however, data analysis is an intrinsically adaptive process, with new analyses generated on the basis of data exploration, as well as the results of previous analyses on the same data. We demonstrate a new approach for addressing the challenges of adaptivity based on insights from privacy-preserving data analysis. As an application, we show how to safely reuse a holdout data set many times to validate the results of adaptively chosen analyses.},

abstract = {Mammography is currently the most established technique for the early detection of breast cancer. However, mammography would benefit from further improvements as it does produce some errors, such as not finding all early-stage cancers. The objectives of this study were first, to measure the timing of correct and incorrect reading decisions in mammography and second, to exploit those dependencies to improve accuracy in mammographic interpretation. To address these objectives, an experiment was conducted where experienced breast imaging radiologists reviewed 400 mammographic regions equally divided among images that contained simulated benign masses, malignant masses, malignant microcalcifications and no lesions. The experiment recorded the radiologists' decision as well as the length of time the mammogram was interpreted in. The experiment results showed that incorrect detection as well as incorrect classification decisions were associated with longer interpretation times (p<0.0001). The timing results were used to create a model that would flag cases for review that had a higher probability of error. The flagged cases had a median accuracy drop of 13% for detection decisions and 16% for classification decisions compared with unflagged cases. This suggests that interpretation time can be incorporated into mammographic decision-making in order to identify cases with higher probabilities of perceptual error that require further review.},

abstract = {To standardize mammographic reporting, the American College of Radiology mammography developed the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) lexicon. However, wide variability is observed in practice in the application of the BIRADS terminology and this leads to classification errors. This review analyses the reasons for variations in BIRADS mammography, describes the types of errors made by readers with illustrated examples, and details BIRADS category 3 which is the most difficult category to use in practice.},

abstract = {Partial expected value of perfect information (EVPI) calculations can quantify the value of learning about particular subsets of uncertain parameters in decision models. Published case studies have used different computational approaches. This article examines the computation of partial EVPI estimates via Monte Carlo sampling algorithms. The mathematical definition shows 2 nested expectations, which must be evaluated separately because of the need to compute a maximum between them. A generalized Monte Carlo sampling algorithm uses nested simulation with an outer loop to sample parameters of interest and, conditional upon these, an inner loop to sample remaining uncertain parameters. Alternative computation methods and shortcut algorithms are discussed and mathematical conditions for their use considered. Maxima of Monte Carlo estimates of expectations are biased upward, and the authors show that the use of small samples results in biased EVPI estimates. Three case studies illustrate 1) the bias due to maximization and also the inaccuracy of shortcut algorithms 2) when correlated variables are present and 3) when there is nonlinearity in net benefit functions. If relatively small correlation or nonlinearity is present, then the shortcut algorithm can be substantially inaccurate. Empirical investigation of the numbers of Monte Carlo samples suggests that fewer samples on the outer level and more on the inner level could be efficient and that relatively small numbers of samples can sometimes be used. Several remaining areas for methodological development are set out. A wider application of partial EVPI is recommended both for greater understanding of decision uncertainty and for analyzing research priorities.},

Despite extraordinary advances in imaging and information technologies, the form and content of radiology reporting has changed little in the discipline's more than 100-year history. In this commentary, we outline the challenges that have confronted innovations such as speech recognition and structured reporting and call for a radical rethinking of the reporting process. By combining new applications with the expanding power of radiology and hospital information systems, the attention of the radiologist---and his or her referring colleagues---could be more focused on the image and its meaning.CONCLUSION. One promising result of such a change in focus could be improved and more reliable communication, already an area of heightened concern in the imaging community. Moreover, such a shift away from the printed word to image-centered content could lead to benefits in shared image viewing; more streamlined and timely reporting; data mining of aggregate results; and image archives, and, ultimately, enhancement of the consultative value of the radiologist's contribution to patient care and treatment.},

abstract = {Articles about medical diagnostic decision support (MDDS) systems often begin with a disclaimer such as, ``despite many years of research and millions of dollars of expenditures on medical diagnostic systems, none is in widespread use at the present time.'' While this statement remains true in the sense that no single diagnostic system is in widespread use, it is misleading with regard to the state of the art of these systems. Diagnostic systems, many simple and some complex, are now ubiquitous, and research on MDDS systems is growing. The nature of MDDS systems has diversified overtime. The prospects for adoption of large- scale diagnostic systems are better now than ever before, due to enthusiasm for implementation of the electronic medical record in academic, commercial, and primary care settings. Diagnostic decision support systems have become an established component of medical technology. This paper provides a review and a threaded bibliography for some of the important work on MDDS systems over the years from 1954 to 1993.},

abstract = {We analysed primary breast cancers by genomic DNA copy number arrays, DNA methylation, exome sequencing, messenger RNA arrays, microRNA sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays. Our ability to integrate information across platforms provided key insights into previously defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining data from five platforms, each of which shows significant molecular heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature within the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological finding of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major biological subtypes of breast cancer.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:To determine whether a Bayesian network trained on a large database of patient demographic risk factors and radiologist-observed findings from consecutive clinical mammography examinations can exceed radiologist performance in the classification of mammographic findings as benign or malignant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:The institutional review board exempted this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study from requiring informed consent. Structured reports from 48 744 consecutive pooled screening and diagnostic mammography examinations in 18 269 patients from April 5, 1999 to February 9, 2004 were collected. Mammographic findings were matched with a state cancer registry, which served as the reference standard. By using 10-fold cross validation, the Bayesian network was tested and trained to estimate breast cancer risk by using demographic risk factors (age, family and personal history of breast cancer, and use of hormone replacement therapy) and mammographic findings recorded in the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon. The performance of radiologists compared with the Bayesian network was evaluated by using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity.

RESULTS:The Bayesian network significantly exceeded the performance of interpreting radiologists in terms of AUC (0.960 vs 0.939, P = .002), sensitivity (90.0% vs 85.3%, P < .001), and specificity (93.0% vs 88.1%, P < .001).

CONCLUSION:On the basis of prospectively collected variables, the evaluated Bayesian network can predict the probability of breast cancer and exceed interpreting radiologist performance. Bayesian networks may help radiologists improve mammographic interpretation.},

We regularize this classifier by aggregating histograms in the neighborhood of each superpixel and then refine our results further by using the classifier in a conditional random field operating on the superpixel graph.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Women with elevated mammographic density have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. However, among women diagnosed with breast cancer, it is unclear whether higher density portends reduced survival, independent of other factors.

METHODS:We evaluated relationships between mammographic density and risk of death from breast cancer and all causes within the US Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. We studied 9232 women diagnosed with primary invasive breast carcinoma during 1996-2005, with a mean follow-up of 6.6 years. Mammographic density was assessed using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density classification. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression; women with scattered fibroglandular densities (BI-RADS 2) were the referent group. All statistical tests were two-sided.

RESULTS:A total of 1795 women died, of whom 889 died of breast cancer. In multivariable analyses (adjusted for site, age at and year of diagnosis, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, body mass index, mode of detection, treatment, and income), high density (BI-RADS 4) was not related to risk of death from breast cancer (HR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.71 to 1.19) or death from all causes (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.68 to 1.02). Analyses stratified by stage and other prognostic factors yielded similar results, except for an increased risk of breast cancer death among women with low density (BI-RADS 1) who were either obese (HR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.37 to 2.97) or had tumors of at least 2.0 cm (HR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.14 to 2.09).

CONCLUSIONS:High mammographic breast density was not associated with risk of death from breast cancer or death from any cause after accounting for other patient and tumor characteristics. Thus, risk factors for the development of breast cancer may not necessarily be the same as factors influencing the risk of death after breast cancer has developed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Several genes underlying rare monogenic forms of Parkinson's disease have been identified over the past decade. Despite evidence for a role for genetics in sporadic Parkinson's disease, few common genetic variants have been unequivocally linked to this disorder. We sought to identify any common genetic variability exerting a large effect in risk for Parkinson's disease in a population cohort and to produce publicly available genome-wide genotype data that can be openly mined by interested researchers and readily augmented by genotyping of additional repository subjects.

METHODS:We did genome-wide, single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of publicly available samples from a cohort of Parkinson's disease patients (n=267) and neurologically normal controls (n=270). More than 408,000 unique SNPs were used from the Illumina Infinium I and HumanHap300 assays.

FINDINGS:We have produced around 220 million genotypes in 537 participants. This raw genotype data has been and as such is the first publicly accessible high-density SNP data outside of the International HapMap Project. We also provide here the results of genotype and allele association tests.

INTERPRETATION:We generated publicly available genotype data for Parkinson's disease patients and controls so that these data can be mined and augmented by other researchers to identify common genetic variability that results in minor and moderate risk for disease.},

Understanding sources of facility variation could become a foundation for improving interpretive performance.Methods In this cross-sectional study conducted between 1996 and 2002, we surveyed 53 facilities to evaluate associations between facility structure, interpretive process characteristics, and interpretive performance of screening mammography (ie, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV1], and the likelihood of cancer among women who were referred for biopsy [PPV2]). Measures of interpretive performance were ascertained prospectively from mammography interpretations and cancer data collected by the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses estimated the association between facility characteristics and mammography interpretive performance or accuracy (area under the ROC curve [AUC]). All P values were two-sided.Results Of the 53 eligible facilities, data on 44 could be analyzed. These 44 facilities accounted for 484 463 screening mammograms performed on 237 669 women, of whom 2686 were diagnosed with breast cancer during follow-up. Among the 44 facilities, mean sensitivity was 79.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74.3% to 84.9%), mean specificity was 90.2% (95% CI = 88.3% to 92.0%), mean PPV1 was 4.1% (95% CI = 3.5% to 4.7%), and mean PPV2 was 38.8% (95% CI = 32.6% to 45.0%). The facilities varied statistically significantly in specificity (P < .001), PPV1 (P < .001), and PPV2 (P = .002) but not in sensitivity (P = .99). AUC was higher among facilities that offered screening mammograms alone vs those that offered screening and diagnostic mammograms (0.943 vs 0.911, P = .006), had a breast imaging specialist interpreting mammograms vs not (0.932 vs 0.905, P = .004), did not perform double reading vs independent double reading vs consensus double reading (0.925 vs 0.915 vs 0.887, P = .034), or conducted audit reviews two or more times per year vs annually vs at an unknown frequency (0.929 vs 0.904 vs 0.900, P = .018).Conclusion Mammography interpretive performance varies statistically significantly by facility.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the effectiveness of screening mammography by estimating the variability in radiologists' ability to detect breast cancer within the US population of radiologists at mammography centers accredited by the American College of Radiology.

METHODS:A two-way sample survey design was used as follows. Fifty mammography centers having an American College of Radiology-accredited unit were randomly sampled from across the United States. One hundred eight radiologists from these centers gave blinded interpretation to the same set of 79 randomly selected screening mammograms. The mammograms were from women who had been screened at a large screening center. Before their sampling, these women had been stratified by their breast disease status, established either by biopsy or by 2-year follow-up. Rates of biopsy recommendations were summarized by the mean, median, minimum, maximum, and range of sensitivity and specificity. Overall cancer detection ability was summarized by similar statistics for receiver operating characteristic curve areas. Ninety-five percent lower confidence bounds on the ranges in accuracy measures were established by boo-strapping.

RESULTS:There is a range of at least 40% among US radiologists in their screening sensitivity. There is a range of at least 45% in the rates at which women without breast cancer are recommended for biopsy. As indicated by receiver operating characteristic curve areas, the ability of radiologists to detect cancer mammograms varies by as much as 11%.

CONCLUSIONS:Our findings indicate that there is wide variability in the accuracy of mammogram interpretation in the population of US radiologists. Current accreditation programs that certify the technical quality of radiographic equipment and images but not the accuracy of the interpretation given to mammograms may not be sufficient to help mammography fully realize its potential to reduce breast cancer mortality.},

abstract = {To assist in medical counseling, we present a method to estimate the chance that a woman with given age and risk factors will develop breast cancer over a specified interval. The risk factors used were age at menarche, age at first live birth, number of previous biopsies, and number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer. A model of relative risks for various combinations of these factors was developed from case-control data from the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP). The model allowed for the fact that relative risks associated with previous breast biopsies were smaller for women aged 50 or more than for younger women. Thus, the proportional hazards assumption was relaxed to allow separate proportional hazards models for those under age 50 and for those of age 50 or more. The baseline age-specific hazard rate, which is the rate for a patient without identified risk factors, is computed as the product of the observed age-specific composite hazard rate times the quantity 1 minus the attributable risk. We calculated individualized breast cancer probabilities from information on relative risks and the baseline hazard rate. These calculations take competing risks and the interval of risk into account. Our data were derived from women who participated in the BCDDP and who tended to return for periodic examinations. For this reason, the risk projections given are probably most reliable for counseling women who plan to be examined about once a year. [J Natl Cancer Inst 81: 1879--1886, 1989]},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether training in the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) improves observer performance and agreement with the consensus of experienced breast imagers with regard to mammographic feature analysis and final assessment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A test set of mammograms was developed, with 54 proven lesions consisting of 28 masses (nine [32%] malignancies) and 26 microcalcifications (10 [38%] malignancies). Three experienced breast imagers reviewed cases independently and by means of consensus. Twenty-three practicing mammogram-interpreting physicians reviewed mammograms before and after a day's lectures on BI-RADS. Observer performance before and after training was measured by means of agreement ($\kappa$) with consensus description and assessments, rate of biopsy of malignant and benign lesions, and areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Performance was also measured for 11 participants 2--3 months after training.RESULTS: Improved agreement with consensus feature analysis was found for mass margins and/or asymmetries, with a pretraining generalized $\kappa$ value of 0.36 and a posttraining generalized $\kappa$ value of 0.41. Similar improvement was seen for description of calcification morphology (pretraining $\kappa$ value of 0.36 improving to 0.44 after training). No improvement was seen in describing calcification distribution. Final assessments were more consistent after training, with a pretraining $\kappa$ value of 0.31, as compared with 0.45 after training. The mean biopsy rate for malignant lesions improved from 73% (range, 53%--89%) before training to 88% (range, 74%--100%) after training, with minimal increase in mean biopsy rate of benign lesions (43% [range, 26%--60%] before to 51% [range, 31%--63%] after training), and no net change in area under the ROC curve, as compared with histopathologic findings. For the subset of participants with delayed follow-up, no significant decline in posttraining results was seen.CONCLUSION: BI-RADS training resulted in improved agreement with the consensus of experienced breast imagers for feature analysis and final assessment. It is important that trainees showed improved rates of recommending biopsy for malignant lesions. This effect was maintained over 2--3 months.{\copyright} RSNA, 2002},

abstract = {An influence diagram is a graphical structure for modeling uncertain variables and decisions and explicitly revealing probabilistic dependence and the flow of information. It is an intuitive framework in which to formulate problems as perceived by decision makers and to incorporate the knowledge of experts. At the same time, it is a precise description of information that can be stored and manipulated by a computer. We develop an algorithm that can evaluate any well-formed influence diagram and determine the optimal policy for its decisions. Since the diagram can be analyzed directly, there is no need to construct other representations such as a decision tree. As a result, the analysis can be performed using the decision maker's perspective on the problem. Questions of sensitivity and the value of information are natural and easily posed. Modifications to the model suggested by such analyses can be made directly to the problem formulation, and then evaluated directly.},

The nodes correspond to variables which can be constants, uncertain quantities, decisions, or objectives. The arcs reveal the probabilistic dependence of the uncertain quantities and the information available at the time of the decisions. The detailed data about the variables are stored within the nodes, so the diagram graph is compact and focuses attention on the relationships among the variables. Influence diagrams are effective communication tools and recent developments also allow them to be used for analysis. We develop algorithms to address questions of inference within a probabilistic model represented as an influence diagram. We use the conditional independence implied by the diagram's structure to determine the information needed to solve a given problem. When there is enough information we can solve it, exploiting that conditional independence. These same results are applied to problems of decision analysis. This methodology allows the construction of computer tools to maintain and evaluate complex models.},

abstract = {Information and communication technology in healthcare promises optimized patient care while ensuring efficiency and cost-effectiveness. However, the promised results are not yet achieved; the healthcare process requires analysis and radical redesign to achieve improvements in care quality and productivity. Healthcare process reengineering is thus necessary and involves modeling its workflow. Even though the healthcare process is very large and not very well modeled yet, its sub-processes can be modeled individually, providing fundamental pieces of the whole model. In this paper, we are interested in modeling the radiology interpretation process that results in generating a diagnostic radiology report. This radiology report is an important clinical element of the patient healthcare record and assists in healthcare decisions. We present the radiology interpretation process by identifying its boundaries and by positioning it on the large healthcare process map. Moreover, we discuss an information data model and identify roles, tasks and several information flows. Furthermore, we describe standard frameworks to enable radiology interpretation workflow implementations between heterogeneous systems.},

We first created multiple working prototypes, each differing in one of three user-interface characteristics. Then we empirically evaluated the prototypes in a controlled, experimental setting for their efficiencies in enabling users to create patient progress notes. The prototype that allowed the fastest data entry had the following three user-interface characteristics: it used a paging form, used a fixed palette of modifiers, and made available all findings from the controlled vocabulary at once.},

ATHENA DSS has an easily modifiable knowledge base that specifies eligibility criteria, risk stratification, blood pressure targets, relevant comorbid diseases, guideline-recommended drug classes for patients with comorbid disease, preferred drugs within each drug class, and clinical messages. Because evidence for best management of hypertension evolves continually, ATHENA DSS is designed to allow clinical experts to customize the knowledge base to incorporate new evidence or to reflect local interpretations of guideline ambiguities. Together with its database mediator Athenaeum, ATHENA DSS has physical and logical data independence from the legacy Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) supplying the patient data, so it can be integrated into a variety of electronic medical record systems.},

abstract = {In a two-level nested simulation, an outer level of simulation samples scenarios, while the inner level uses simulation to estimate a conditional expectation given the scenario. Applications include financial risk management, assessing the effects of simulation input uncertainty, and computing the expected value of gathering more information in decision theory. We show that an ANOVA-like estimator of the variance of the conditional expectation is unbiased under mild conditions, and we discuss the optimal number of inner-level samples to minimize this estimator's variance given a fixed computational budget. We show that as the computational budget increases, the optimal number of inner-level samples remains bounded. This finding contrasts with previous work on two-level simulation problems in which the inner- and outer-level sample sizes must both grow without bound for the estimation error to approach zero. The finding implies that the variance of a conditional expectation can be estimated to arbitrarily high precision by a simulation experiment with a fixed inner-level computational effort per scenario, which we call a one-and-a-half-level simulation. Because the optimal number of inner-level samples is often quite small, a one-and-a-half-level simulation can avoid the heavy computational burden typically associated with two-level simulation.},

abstract = {Motivation: Numerous competing algorithms for prediction in high-dimensional settings have been developed in the statistical and machine-learning literature. Learning algorithms and the prediction models they generate are typically evaluated on the basis of cross-validation error estimates in a few exemplary datasets. However, in most applications, the ultimate goal of prediction modeling is to provide accurate predictions for independent samples obtained in different settings. Cross-validation within exemplary datasets may not adequately reflect performance in the broader application context.Methods: We develop and implement a systematic approach to `cross-study validation', to replace or supplement conventional cross-validation when evaluating high-dimensional prediction models in independent datasets. We illustrate it via simulations and in a collection of eight estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer microarray gene-expression datasets, where the objective is predicting distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). We computed the C-index for all pairwise combinations of training and validation datasets. We evaluate several alternatives for summarizing the pairwise validation statistics, and compare these to conventional cross-validation.Results: Our data-driven simulations and our application to survival prediction with eight breast cancer microarray datasets, suggest that standard cross-validation produces inflated discrimination accuracy for all algorithms considered, when compared to cross-study validation. Furthermore, the ranking of learning algorithms differs, suggesting that algorithms performing best in cross-validation may be suboptimal when evaluated through independent validation.Availability: The survHD: Survival in High Dimensions package (http://www.bitbucket.org/lwaldron/survhd) will be made available through Bioconductor.Contact: levi.waldron@hunter.cuny.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

As voice recognition (VR) becomes more prevalent in radiology practice, there is opportunity for implementing NLP in real time for decision-support applications such as context-aware information retrieval. For example, as the radiologist dictates a report, an NLP algorithm can extract concepts from the text and retrieve relevant classification or diagnosis criteria or calculate disease probability. NLP can work in parallel with VR to potentially facilitate evidence-based reporting (for example, automatically retrieving the Bosniak classification when the radiologist describes a kidney cyst). For these reasons, we developed and validated an NLP system which extracts fracture and anatomy concepts from unstructured text and retrieves relevant bone fracture knowledge. We implement our NLP in an HTML5 web application to demonstrate a proof-of-concept feedback NLP system which retrieves bone fracture knowledge in real time.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Despite the proved value of mammography in screening for breast cancer, its efficacy depends on radiologists' interpretations. The variability in such interpretations is not well understood.

METHODS:Using a technique of stratified random sampling, we selected 150 mammograms obtained in 1987: 27 from women with histopathologically confirmed breast cancer and 123 from women with no evidence of breast cancer after three years of follow-up examinations. Ten radiologists, who were unaware of the diagnoses and research hypothesis, each interpreted the 150 mammograms. Disagreement was analyzed within pairs of the 10 radiologists, as well as for the group of 150 women as a whole.

RESULTS:The diagnostic consistency between pairs of radiologists was moderate, with a median weighted percentage of agreement of 78 percent (weighted kappa, 0.47). The frequency of the radiologists' recommendations for an immediate workup ranged from 74 to 96 percent for mammograms from the women with cancer and from 11 to 65 percent for films from the women without cancer. A substantial disagreement in management recommendations--in which one radiologist recommended routine follow-up and another recommended a biopsy for the same patient--occurred in 3 percent of the pairwise comparisons but in 25 percent of the comparisons for the group of women as a whole. When two or more radiologists recommended a biopsy for the same patient, a disagreement in the stated location (right or left breast) occurred in 2 percent of the pairwise comparisons among the radiologists but in 9 percent of comparisons for the group of women as a whole. Because some disagreement was likely, given that 10 radiologists read each film, the pairwise comparison is a more conservative estimate of disagreement.

CONCLUSIONS:Although mammography is of value in screening women for breast cancer, radiologists can differ, sometimes substantially, in their interpretations of mammograms and in their recommendations for management. Efforts to improve accuracy and reduce variability in interpretation may increase the effectiveness of mammography in detecting early breast cancers.},

However, data available from real-world settings are sparse. We studied mammographic examination interpretations by radiologists practicing in a community setting and evaluated whether the variability in false-positive rates could be explained by patient, radiologist, and/or testing characteristics. Methods: We used medical records on randomly selected women aged 40--69 years who had had at least one screening mammographic examination in a community setting between January 1, 1985, and June 30, 1993. Twenty-four radiologists interpreted 8734 screening mammograms from 2169 women. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to examine the impact of patient, radiologist, and testing characteristics. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Radiologists varied widely in mammographic examination interpretations, with a mass noted in 0%--7.9%, calcification in 0%--21.3%, and fibrocystic changes in 1.6%--27.8% of mammograms read. False-positive rates ranged from 2.6% to 15.9%. Younger and more recently trained radiologists had higher false-positive rates. Adjustment for patient, radiologist, and testing characteristics narrowed the range of false-positive rates to 3.5%--7.9%. If a woman went to two randomly selected radiologists, her odds, after adjustment, of having a false-positive reading would be 1.5 times greater for the radiologist at higher risk of a false-positive reading, compared with the radiologist at lowest risk (95% highest posterior density interval [similar to a confidence interval] = 1.17 to 2.08). Conclusion: Community radiologists varied widely in their false-positive rates in screening mammograms; this variability range was reduced by half, but not eliminated, after statistical adjustment for patient, radiologist, and testing characteristics. These characteristics need to be considered when evaluating false-positive rates in community mammographic examination screening.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The introduction of picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) frequently includes the option of computer-generated itemized reports. This motivated us to reassess the merits of traditional prose dictated reports. This study examines radiologist and clinician preferences regarding report style and content.MATERIALS AND METHODS. The study was conducted in two parts. The first part was a retrospective audit of existing medical imaging prose reports to determine their content. The second part comprised a questionnaire containing three mock clinical scenarios. Three pairs of reports were provided for each scenario, with only essential information in the first pair, some optional information in the second, and the most complete report in the third. Each pair consisted of a prose and itemized report with identical content. Participants ranked reports by preference and were asked specific questions regarding report content. The questionnaires were mailed to referring clinicians and administered during an interactive forum to staff radiologists, radiology fellows, and radiology residents.RESULTS. The audit of existing reports showed a wide variation in all fields with consistency limited to a given radiologist. Responses to the questionnaire showed that, in general, a majority of radiologists and referring clinicians preferred itemized reports. The itemized report with the most detailed content was ranked highest of all three scenarios.CONCLUSION. Prose reports foster a lack of standardization of content among different radiologists. Itemized reports facilitate complete documentation of information and measurements and are more popular with both radiologists and referring clinicians.},

abstract = {Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate trends in utilization and spending for medical imaging, using medical visits resulting in imaging as a novel metric of utilization. Methods Utilization and spending for medical imaging were examined using (1) Medicare Part B claims data from 2003 to 2011 to measure per-enrollee spending and (2) household component events data on the elderly Medicare-age population from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2003 to 2010 to measure utilization as a function of clinical encounters. Results Annual health spending and Medicare payments for imaging for the elderly population grew from $294 per enrollee in 2003 to $418 in 2006 and had declined to $390 by 2011. Over this entire time, however, annual medical visits by a similar Medicare-age (≥65 years old) population resulting in imaging trended consistently downward, from 12.8% in 2003 to 10.6% in 2011. Conclusions Despite early growth and then more recent declines in average Medicare spending per enrollee since 2003, the percentage of patient encounters resulting in medical imaging has significantly and consistently declined nationwide. Spending alone is thus an incomplete measure of changes in the role and utilization of medical imaging in overall patient care. As policymakers focus on medical imaging, a thoughtful analysis of payment policy influencing imaging utilization, and its role in concurrent and downstream patient care, will be critical to ensure appropriate patient access.},

Materials and Methods. The performance of bootstrap estimates was evaluated and compared with that of analytic estimates by using a simulation study. Bootstrapping was demonstrated by using data from a previous study comparing two angiographic methods. Results. Analytic and bootstrap estimates had similar coverage rates for 95% confidence intervals. With many sites per patient, bootstrap estimates had slightly better coverage than analytic estimates. Bootstrap percentile intervals had better coverage than asymptotic normal bootstrap intervals. Conclusion. Bootstrapping is a useful method of estimating confidence intervals for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity when data are correlated.},

Each subject was re-tested on four occasions at least 1 week apart. The results were analysed to assess reproducibility within and between individuals. We found considerable variation in the probabilities assigned to many commonly used expressions between subjects, and between repeated testing of the same subject. Some expressions were rated much more consistently than others. "Absent", "excludes", "unlikely", "probable", "certain" and "definite" were the most consistently rated expressions. We have identified a potential source of misunderstanding in radiological reports owing to differences in interpretation of expressions used by radiologists and referring clinicians.},

abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

We formulate features that respond to characteristic changes in brightness, color, and texture associated with natural boundaries. In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal way, we train a classifier using human labeled images as ground truth. The output of this classifier provides the posterior probability of a boundary at each image location and orientation. We present precision-recall curves showing that the resulting detector significantly outperforms existing approaches. Our two main results are 1) that cue combination can be performed adequately with a simple linear model and 2) that a proper, explicit treatment of texture is required to detect boundaries in natural images.

The substantial information in these reports often causes physicians to focus on the summarized "impression" section. This study evaluated how often a critical finding is documented in the report's "impression" section and describes how an automated application can improve documentation. METHODS: A retrospective review of all chest CT scan reports finalized between October, 2009 and September, 2010 at an academic institution was performed. A natural language processing application was utilized to evaluate the frequency of reporting a pulmonary nodule in the "impression" section, versus the "findings" section of a report. RESULTS: Results showed 3,401 reports with documented pulmonary nodules in the "findings" section, compared to 2,162 in the "impression" section - a 36.4% difference. CONCLUSION: The study revealed significant discrepant documentation in the "findings" versus "impression" sections. Automated systems could improve such critical findings documentation and communication between ordering physicians and radiologists.},

In spite of the advances in technology to improve early diagnosis and an increased emphasis on education to promote awareness of early detection, 46,000 women die annually. A significant number of these losses could be prevented through risk reduction measures, yet many women do not practice breast self-exam (BSE) or receive adequate clinical screening. The purpose of this integrative review is to provide an analysis of the barriers to breast cancer screening with recommendations for future research. The studies will be categorized using the three modalities for breast cancer screening, mammography, clinical breast exam (CBE) and BSE. Demographic variables that impede breast cancer screening will be integrated into each section. The evidence is clear that in spite of breast cancer screening guidelines, increased awareness and access to mammography screening, women in the United States are not being screened adequately. Recommendations for future research will be included.},

abstract = {The following article on HL7 Version 3 will give readers a glimpse into the significant differences between "what came before"--that is, HL7 Version 2.x--and "what today and the future will bring," which is the HL7 Version 3 family of data interchange specifications. The difference between V2.x and V3 is significant, and it exists because the various stakeholders in the HL7 development process believe that the increased depth, breadth, and, to some degree, complexity that characterize V3 are necessary to solve many of today's and tomorrow's increasingly wide, deep and complex healthcare information data interchange requirements. Like many healthcare or technology discussions, this discussion has its own vocabulary of somewhat obscure, but not difficult, terms. This article will define the minimum set that is necessary for readers to appreciate the relevance and capabilities of HL7 Version 3, including how it is different than HL7 Version 2. After that, there will be a brief overview of the primary motivations for HL7 Version 3 in the presence of the unequivocal success of Version 2. In this context, the article will give readers an overview of one of the prime constructs of Version 3, the Reference Information Model (RIM). There are 'four pillars that are necessary but not sufficient to obtain computable semantic interoperability." These four pillars--a cross-domain information model; a robust data type specification; a methodology for separating domain-specific terms from, as well as binding them to, the common model; and a top-down interchange specification methodology and tools for using 1, 2, 3 and defining Version 3 specification--collectively comprise the "HL7 Version 3 Toolkit." Further, this article will present a list of questions and answers to help readers assess the scope and complexity of the problems facing healthcare IT today, and which will further enlighten readers on the "reality" of HL7 Version 3. The article will conclude with a "pseudo-code" argument in favor of the adoption of HL7 Version 3, framed by citing the recommendation of the Interoperability Consortium for the use of HL7 Version 3 as a critical component in the National Health Information Infrastructure.},

The objectives of this study were to develop and apply a method for the grading of the quality of radiology reports and to evaluate differences based on the reader's experience. This grading method permits evaluation of compliance with the American College of Radiology communication standards. Materials and Methods A total of 240 intensive care unit admission chest radiograph reports were retrieved from our hospital database. These were graded for quality. Our grading system is based on the concept that a radiology report must provide information relevant to the patient's known clinical status and thus is important to the ordering clinician. The best grade for a report is IV and the minimum grade assigned is I. Results were further analyzed based on the experience of the reader. Results A total of 436 grades from the 240 reports were generated: 374/436 (86%) grades were designated a III or IV, which we deemed as satisfactory reports. The scoring of the radiology reports evaluating the position of endotracheal tubes, catheters, and enteric feeding tubes scored significantly better than definitive diagnosis as the starting point on the clinical spectrum (P {\&}lt; .01). The scores from all other patients starting points on the clinical spectrum, when compared with one another, were nonsignificant. Using a one-way analysis of variance, when comparing reports based on the six different levels of reader experience, first-year residents up to staff radiologists reports showed no significant difference (P = .78). Conclusions Ideally, 100% of radiology reports should receive a grade III or IV. Our study showed that only 86% of the reports met this standard.},

abstract = {Purpose: To compare the content, clarity, and clinical usefulness of conventional (ie, free-form) and structured radiology reports of body computed tomographic (CT) scans, as evaluated by referring physicians, attending radiologists, and radiology fellows at a tertiary care cancer center.Materials and Methods: The institutional review board approved the study as a quality improvement initiative; no written consent was required. Three radiologists, three radiology fellows, three surgeons, and two medical oncologists evaluated 330 randomly selected conventional and structured radiology reports of body CT scans. For nonradiologists, reports were randomly selected from patients with diagnoses relevant to the physician's area of specialization. Each physician read 15 reports in each format and rated both the content and clarity of each report from 1 (very dissatisfied or very confusing) to 10 (very satisfied or very clear). By using a previously published radiology report grading scale, physicians graded each report's effectiveness in advancing the patient's position on the clinical spectrum. Mixed-effects models were used to test differences between report types.Results: Mean content satisfaction ratings were 7.61 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.12, 8.16) for conventional reports and 8.33 (95% CI: 7.82, 8.86) for structured reports, and the difference was significant (P < .0001). Mean clarity satisfaction ratings were 7.45 (95% CI: 6.89, 8.02) for conventional reports and 8.25 (95% CI: 7.68, 8.82) for structured reports, and the difference was significant (P < .0001). Grade ratings did not differ significantly between conventional and structured reports.Conclusion: Referring clinicians and radiologists found that structured reports had better content and greater clarity than conventional reports.{\copyright} RSNA, 2011Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101913/-/DC1},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE. We sought to evaluate the use of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) standardized mammography lexicon among and within observers and to distinguish variability in feature analysis from variability in lesion management.MATERIALS AND METHODS. Five experienced mammographers, not specifically trained in BI-RADS, used the lexicon to describe and assess 103 screening mammograms, including 30 (29%) showing cancer, and a subset of 86 mammograms with diagnostic evaluation, including 23 (27%) showing cancer. A subset of 13 screening mammograms (two with malignant findings, 11 with diagnostic evaluation) were rereviewed by each observer 2 months later. Kappa statistics were calculated as measures of agreement beyond chance.RESULTS. After diagnostic evaluation, the interobserver kappa values for describing features were as follows: breast density, 0.43; lesion type, 0.75; mass borders, 0.40; special cases, 0.56; mass density, 0.40; mass shape, 0.28; microcalcification morphology, 0.36; and microcalcification distribution, 0.47. Lesion management was highly variable, with a kappa value for final assessment of 0.37. When we grouped assessments recommending immediate additional evaluation and biopsy (BI-RADS categories 0, 4, and 5 combined) versus follow-up (categories 1, 2, and 3 combined), five observers agreed on management for only 47 (55%) of 86 lesions. Intraobserver agreement on management (additional evaluation or biopsy versus follow-up) was seen in 47 (85%) of 55 interpretations, with a kappa value of 0.35-1.0 (mean, 0.60) for final assessment.CONCLUSION. Inter- and intraobserver variability in mammographic interpretation is substantial for both feature analysis and management. Continued development of methods to improve standardization in mammographic interpretation is needed.},

It can be shown that the average F-measure among pairs of experts is numerically identical to the average positive specific agreement among experts and that $\kappa$ approaches these measures as the number of negative cases grows large. Positive specific agreement---or the equivalent F-measure---may be an appropriate way to quantify interrater reliability and therefore to assess the reliability of a gold standard in these studies.},

abstract = {Background Uncertainty exists about the appropriate use of screening mammography among older women because comorbid illnesses may diminish the benefit of screening. We examined the risk of adverse tumor characteristics and false positive rates according to screening interval, age, and comorbidity.Methods From January 1999 to December 2006, data were collected prospectively on 2993 older women with breast cancer and 137 949 older women without breast cancer who underwent mammography at facilities that participated in a data linkage between the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium and Medicare claims. Women were aged 66 to 89 years at study entry to allow for measurement of 1 year of preexisting illnesses. We used logistic regression analyses to calculate the odds of advanced (IIb, III, IV) stage, large (>20 millimeters) tumors, and 10-year cumulative probability of false-positive mammography by screening frequency (1 vs 2 years), age, and comorbidity score. The comorbidity score was derived using the Klabunde approximation of the Charlson score. All statistical tests were two-sided.Results Adverse tumor characteristics did not differ statistically significantly by comorbidity, age, or interval. Cumulative probability of a false-positive mammography result was higher among annual screeners than biennial screeners irrespective of comorbidity: 48.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 46.1% to 49.9%) of annual screeners aged 66 to 74 years had a false-positive result compared with 29.0% (95% CI = 28.1% to 29.9%) of biennial screeners.Conclusion Women aged 66 to 89 years who undergo biennial screening mammography have similar risk of advanced-stage disease and lower cumulative risk of a false-positive recommendation than annual screeners, regardless of comorbidity.},

Methods and materials 2D regions of interest in HRCT axial slices from patients affected with an interstitial lung disease are automatically classified into five classes of lung tissue. Relevance of the clinical parameters is studied before fusing them with visual attributes. Two multimedia fusion techniques are compared: early versus late fusion. Early fusion concatenates features in one single vector, yielding a true multimedia feature space. Late fusion consisting of the combination of the probability outputs of two support vector machines. Results and conclusion The late fusion scheme allowed a maximum of 84% correct predictions of testing instances among the five classes of lung tissue. This represents a significant improvement of 10% compared to a pure visual-based classification. Moreover, the late fusion scheme showed high robustness to the number of clinical parameters used, which suggests that it is appropriate for mining clinical attributes with missing values in clinical routine.},

The purpose of this exploratory study was to survey reader practice in reporting screening mammograms in Australia to identify aspects of practice that warrant further investigation. Mammography reporting practice and influences on concentration and attention were investigated by using an original questionnaire distributed to screen readers in Australia. A response rate of 71% (83 out of 117) was achieved. Demographic data indicated that the majority of readers were over 46 years of age (73%), have been reporting on screening mammograms for over 10 years (61%), take less than 1 min to report upon a screening mammogram examination (66%), report up to 200 examinations in a single session (83%) and take up to 2 h to report one session (61%). A majority report on more than 5000 examinations annually (66%); 93% of participants regard their search strategy as systematic, 87% agreed that their concentration can vary throughout a session, 64% agreed that the relatively low number of positives can lead to lapses in concentration and attention and almost all (94%) participants agreed that methods to maximise concentration should be explored. Participants identified a range of influences on concentration within their working environment including volume of images reported in one session, image types and aspects of the physical environment. This study has provided important evidence of the need to investigate adverse influences on concentration during mammography screen reporting},

abstract = {PURPOSE Cancer screening programs have the potential of intended beneficial effects, but they also inevitably have unintended harmful effects. In the case of screening mammography, the most frequent harm is a false-positive result. Prior efforts to measure their psychosocial consequences have been limited by short-term follow-up, the use of generic survey instruments, and the lack of a relevant benchmark---women with breast cancer.METHODS In this cohort study with a 3-year follow-up, we recruited 454 women with abnormal findings in screening mammography over a 1-year period. For each woman with an abnormal finding on a screening mammogram (false and true positives), we recruited another 2 women with normal screening results who were screened the same day at the same clinic. These participants were asked to complete the Consequences of Screening in Breast Cancer---a validated questionnaire encompassing 12 psychosocial outcomes---at baseline, 1, 6, 18, and 36 months.RESULTS Six months after final diagnosis, women with false-positive findings reported changes in existential values and inner calmness as great as those reported by women with a diagnosis of breast cancer ($\Delta$ = 1.15; P = .015; and $\Delta$ = 0.13; P = .423, respectively). Three years after being declared free of cancer, women with false-positive results consistently reported greater negative psychosocial consequences compared with women who had normal findings in all 12 psychosocial outcomes ($\Delta$ >0 for 12 of 12 outcomes; P <.01 for 4 of 12 outcomes).CONCLUSION False-positive findings on screening mammography causes long-term psychosocial harm: 3 years after a false-positive finding, women experience psychosocial consequences that range between those experienced by women with a normal mammogram and those with a diagnosis of breast cancer.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Controversy exists about the frequency women should undergo screening mammography and whether screening interval should vary according to risk factors beyond age . OBJECTIVE To compare the benefits and harms of screening mammography frequencies according to age, breast density, and postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) use. DESIGN Prospective cohort. SETTING Data collected January 1994 to December 2008 from mammography facilities in community practice that participate in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) mammography registries. PARTICIPANTS Data were collected prospectively on 11 474 women with breast cancer and 922 624 without breast cancer who underwent mammography at facilities that participate in the BCSC. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We used logistic regression to calculate the odds of advanced stage (IIb, III, or IV) and large tumors ({\&}gt;20 mm in diameter) and 10-year cumulative probability of a false-positive mammography result by screening frequency, age, breast density, and HT use. The main predictor was screening mammography interval. RESULTS Mammography biennially vs annually for women aged 50 to 74 years does not increase risk of tumors with advanced stage or large size regardless of women's breast density or HT use. Among women aged 40 to 49 years with extremely dense breasts, biennial mammography vs annual is associated with increased risk of advanced-stage cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; 95% CI, 1.06-3.39) and large tumors (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.37-4.18). Cumulative probability of a false-positive mammography result was high among women undergoing annual mammography with extremely dense breasts who were either aged 40 to 49 years (65.5%) or used estrogen plus progestogen (65.8%) and was lower among women aged 50 to 74 years who underwent biennial or triennial mammography with scattered fibroglandular densities (30.7% and 21.9%, respectively) or fatty breasts (17.4% and 12.1%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Women aged 50 to 74 years, even those with high breast density or HT use, who undergo biennial screening mammography have similar risk of advanced-stage disease and lower cumulative risk of false-positive results than those who undergo annual mammography. When deciding whether to undergo mammography, women aged 40 to 49 years who have extremely dense breasts should be informed that annual mammography may minimize their risk of advanced-stage disease but the cumulative risk of false-positive results is high.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To compare trends in breast cancer mortality within three pairs of neighbouring European countries in relation to implementation of screening.

DESIGN:Retrospective trend analysis.

SETTING:Three country pairs (Northern Ireland (United Kingdom) v Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands v Belgium and Flanders (Belgian region south of the Netherlands), and Sweden v Norway).

DATA SOURCES:WHO mortality database on cause of death and data sources on mammography screening, cancer treatment, and risk factors for breast cancer mortality.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Changes in breast cancer mortality calculated from linear regressions of log transformed, age adjusted death rates. Joinpoint analysis was used to identify the year when trends in mortality for all ages began to change.

RESULTS:From 1989 to 2006, deaths from breast cancer decreased by 29% in Northern Ireland and by 26% in the Republic of Ireland; by 25% in the Netherlands and by 20% in Belgium and 25% in Flanders; and by 16% in Sweden and by 24% in Norway. The time trend and year of downward inflexion were similar between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and between the Netherlands and Flanders. In Sweden, mortality rates have steadily decreased since 1972, with no downward inflexion until 2006. Countries of each pair had similar healthcare services and prevalence of risk factors for breast cancer mortality but differing implementation of mammography screening, with a gap of about 10-15 years.

CONCLUSIONS:The contrast between the time differences in implementation of mammography screening and the similarity in reductions in mortality between the country pairs suggest that screening did not play a direct part in the reductions in breast cancer mortality.},

abstract = {The yeast AGC kinase orthologs Ypk1 and Ypk2 control several important cellular processes, including actin polarization, endocytosis, and sphingolipid metabolism. Activation of Ypk1/2 requires phosphorylation by kinases localized at the plasma membrane (PM), including the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 orthologs Pkh1/Pkh2 and the target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2). Unlike their mammalian counterparts SGK and Akt, Ypk1 and Ypk2 lack an identifiable lipid-targeting motif; therefore, how these proteins are recruited to the PM has remained elusive. To explore Ypk1/2 function, we constructed ATP analog-sensitive alleles of both kinases and monitored global changes in gene expression following their inhibition, where we observed increased expression of stress-responsive target genes controlled by Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. TORC2 has been shown previously to negatively regulate calcineurin in part by phosphorylating two related proteins, Slm1 and Slm2, which associate with the PM via plextrin homology domains. We therefore investigated the relationship between Slm1 and Ypk1 and discovered that these proteins interact physically and that Slm1 recruits Ypk1 to the PM for phosphorylation by TORC2. We observed further that these steps facilitate subsequent phosphorylation of Ypk1 by Pkh1/2. Remarkably, a requirement for Slm1, can be bypassed by fusing the plextrin homology domain of Slm1 alone onto Ypk1, demonstrating that the essential function of Slm1 is largely attributable to its role in Ypk1 activation. These findings both extend the scope of cellular processes regulated by Ypk1/2 to include negative regulation of calcineurin and broaden the repertoire of mechanisms for membrane recruitment and activation of a protein kinase.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Radiologists differ in their ability to interpret screening mammograms accurately. We investigated the relationship of radiologist characteristics to actual performance from 1996 to 2001.

METHODS:Screening mammograms (n = 469,512) interpreted by 124 radiologists were linked to cancer outcome data. The radiologists completed a survey that included questions on demographics, malpractice concerns, years of experience interpreting mammograms, and the number of mammograms read annually. We used receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to analyze variables associated with sensitivity, specificity, and the combination of the two, adjusting for patient variables that affect performance. All P values are two-sided.

RESULTS:Within 1 year of the mammogram, 2402 breast cancers were identified. Relative to low annual interpretive volume (< or =1000 mammograms), greater interpretive volume was associated with higher sensitivity (P = .001; odds ratio [OR] for moderate volume [1001-2000] = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.18 to 2.39; OR for high volume [>2000] = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.36 to 2.63). Specificity decreased with volume (OR for 1001-2000 = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.52 to 0.83; OR for more than 2000 = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.96), compared with 1000 or less (P = .002). Greater number of years of experience interpreting mammograms was associated with lower sensitivity (P = .001), but higher specificity (P = .003). ROC analysis using the ordinal BI-RADS interpretation showed an association between accuracy and both previous mammographic history (P = .012) and breast density (P<.001). No association was observed between accuracy and years interpreting mammograms (P = .34) or mammography volume (P = .94), after adjusting for variables that affect the threshold for calling a mammogram positive.

CONCLUSIONS:We found no evidence that greater volume or experience at interpreting mammograms is associated with better performance. However, they may affect sensitivity and specificity, possibly by determining the threshold for calling a mammogram positive. Increasing volume requirements is unlikely to improve overall mammography performance.},

abstract = {The performance of the human eye and brain has failed to keep pace with the enormous technical progress in the first full century of radiology. Errors and variations in interpretation now represent the weakest aspect of clinical imaging. Those interpretations which differ from the consensus view of a panel of "experts" may be regarded as errors; where experts fail to achieve consensus, differing reports are regarded as "observer variation". Errors arise from poor technique, failures of perception, lack of knowledge and misjudgments. Observer variation is substantial and should be taken into account when different diagnostic methods are compared; in many cases the difference between observers outweighs the difference between techniques. Strategies for reducing error include attention to viewing conditions, training of the observers, availability of previous films and relevant clinical data, dual or multiple reporting, standardization of terminology and report format, and assistance from computers. Digital acquisition and display will probably not affect observer variation but the performance of radiologists, as measured by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, may be improved by computer-directed search for specific image features. Other current developments show that where image features can be comprehensively described, computer analysis can replace the perception function of the observer, whilst the function of interpretation can in some cases be performed better by artificial neural networks. However, computer-assisted diagnosis is still in its infancy and complete replacement of the human observer is as yet a remote possibility.},

abstract = {Background: Identifying risk factors for breast cancer specific to women in their 40s could inform screening decisions.Purpose: To determine what factors increase risk for breast cancer in women aged 40 to 49 years and the magnitude of risk for each factor.Data Sources: MEDLINE (January 1996 to the second week of November 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (fourth quarter of 2011), Scopus, reference lists of published studies, and the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium.Study Selection: English-language studies and systematic reviews of risk factors for breast cancer in women aged 40 to 49 years. Additional inclusion criteria were applied for each risk factor.Data Extraction: Data on participants, study design, analysis, follow-up, and outcomes were abstracted. Study quality was rated by using established criteria, and only studies rated as good or fair were included. Results were summarized by using meta-analysis when sufficient studies were available or from the best evidence based on study quality, size, and applicability when meta-analysis was not possible. Data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium were analyzed with proportional hazards models by using partly conditional Cox regression. Reference groups for comparisons were set at U.S. population means.Data Synthesis: Sixty-six studies provided data for estimates. Extremely dense breasts on mammography or first-degree relatives with breast cancer were associated with at least a 2-fold increase in risk for breast cancer. Prior breast biopsy, second-degree relatives with breast cancer, or heterogeneously dense breasts were associated with a 1.5- to 2.0-fold increased risk; current use of oral contraceptives, nulliparity, and age 30 years or older at first birth were associated with a 1.0- to 1.5-fold increased risk.Limitations: Studies varied by measures, reference groups, and adjustment for confounders, which could bias combined estimates. Effects of multiple risk factors were not considered.Conclusion: Extremely dense breasts and first-degree relatives with breast cancer were each associated with at least a 2-fold increase in risk for breast cancer in women aged 40 to 49 years. Identification of these risk factors may be useful for personalized mammography screening.Primary Funding Source: National Cancer Institute.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION:Mammographic density is known to be a strong risk factor for breast cancer. A particularly strong association with risk has been observed when density is measured using interactive threshold software. This, however, is a labour-intensive process for large-scale studies.

METHODS:Our aim was to determine the performance of visually assessed percent breast density as an indicator of breast cancer risk. We compared the effect on risk of density as measured with the mediolateral oblique view only versus that estimated as the average density from the mediolateral oblique view and the craniocaudal view. Density was assessed using a visual analogue scale in 10,048 screening mammograms, including 311 breast cancer cases diagnosed at that screening episode or within the following 6 years.

RESULTS:Where only the mediolateral oblique view was available, there was a modest effect of breast density on risk with an odds ratio for the 76% to 100% density relative to 0% to 25% of 1.51 (95% confidence interval 0.71 to 3.18). When two views were available, there was a considerably stronger association, with the corresponding odds ratio being 6.77 (95% confidence interval 2.75 to 16.67).

CONCLUSION:This indicates that a substantial amount of information on risk from percentage breast density is contained in the second view. It also suggests that visually assessed breast density has predictive potential for breast cancer risk comparable to that of density measured using the interactive threshold software when two views are available. This observation needs to be confirmed by studies applying the different measurement methods to the same individuals.},

abstract = {Background Computer-aided detection (CAD) is applied during screening mammography for millions of US women annually, although it is uncertain whether CAD improves breast cancer detection when used by community radiologists.Methods We investigated the association between CAD use during film-screen screening mammography and specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, cancer detection rates, and prognostic characteristics of breast cancers (stage, size, and node involvement). Records from 684 956 women who received more than 1.6 million film-screen mammograms at Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium facilities in seven states in the United States from 1998 to 2006 were analyzed. We used random-effects logistic regression to estimate associations between CAD and specificity (true-negative examinations among women without breast cancer), sensitivity (true-positive examinations among women with breast cancer diagnosed within 1 year of mammography), and positive predictive value (breast cancer diagnosed after positive mammograms) while adjusting for mammography registry, patient age, time since previous mammography, breast density, use of hormone replacement therapy, and year of examination (1998--2002 vs 2003--2006). All statistical tests were two-sided.Results Of 90 total facilities, 25 (27.8%) adopted CAD and used it for an average of 27.5 study months. In adjusted analyses, CAD use was associated with statistically significantly lower specificity (OR = 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.85 to 0.89, P < .001) and positive predictive value (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.80 to 0.99, P = .03). A non-statistically significant increase in overall sensitivity with CAD (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.84 to 1.33, P = .62) was attributed to increased sensitivity for ductal carcinoma in situ (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 0.83 to 2.91; P = .17), although sensitivity for invasive cancer was similar with or without CAD (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.75 to 1.24; P = .77). CAD was not associated with higher breast cancer detection rates or more favorable stage, size, or lymph node status of invasive breast cancer.Conclusion CAD use during film-screen screening mammography in the United States is associated with decreased specificity but not with improvement in the detection rate or prognostic characteristics of invasive breast cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:There has been much debate about the value of screening mammography. Here we update the overview of the Swedish randomised controlled trials on mammography screening up to and including 1996. The Kopparberg part of the Two-County trial was not available for the overview, but the continuation of the Malm{\"o} trial (MMST II) has been added. The article also contains basic data from the trials that have not been presented before. Methods The trials (n=247010, invited group 129750, control group 117260) have been followed up by record linkage to the Swedish Cancer and Cause of Death Registers. The relative risks (RR) for breast cancer death and mortality were calculated for the invited and the control groups. The trial-specific as well as the age-specific effects were analysed. RRs were calculated by the density method, with total person-time experience of the cohort by time interval of follow-up as a basis for estimating mortality rates. We calculated weighted RRs and 95% CI with the Mantel-Haenszel procedure.

FINDINGS:The median trial time-the time from randomisation until the first round was completed for the control group or if the control group was not invited, until end of follow-up-was 6.5 years (range 3.0-18.1). The median follow-up time, the time from randomisation, to the end of follow-up, was 15.8 years (5.8-20.2). There were 511 breast cancer deaths in 1864770 women-years in the invited groups and 584 breast cancer deaths in 1688440 women-years in the control groups, a significant 21% reduction in breast cancer mortality (RR=0.79, 95% CI 0.70-0.89). The reduction was greatest in the age group 60-69 years at entry (33%). Looking at 5-year age groups, there were statistically significant effects in the age groups 55-59, 60-64, and 65-69 years (RR=0.76, 0.68, and 0.69, respectively). There was a small effect in women 50-54 years at randomisation (RR=0.95). The benefit in terms of cumulative breast cancer mortality started to emerge at about 4 years after randomisation and continued to increase to about 10 years. Thereafter the benefit in absolute terms was maintained throughout the period of observation. The age-adjusted relative risk for the total mortality was 0.98 (0.96-1.00).

INTERPRETATION:The advantageous effect of breast screening on breast cancer mortality persists after long-term follow-up. The recent criticism against the Swedish randomised controlled trials is misleading and scientifically unfounded.},

abstract = {Background: Countries with centralized, high-volume mammography screening programs, such as the U.K. and Sweden, emphasize high specificity (low percentage of false positives) and high sensitivity (high percentage of true positives). By contrast, the United States does not have centralized, high-volume screening programs, emphasizes high sensitivity, and has lower average specificity. We investigated whether high sensitivity can be achieved in the context of high specificity and whether the number of mammograms read per radiologist (reader volume) drives both sensitivity and specificity. Methods: The U.K.'s National Health Service Breast Screening Programme uses the PERFORMS 2 test as a teaching and assessment tool for radiologists. The same 60-film PERFORMS 2 test was given to 194 high-volume U.K. radiologists and to 60 U.S. radiologists, who were assigned to low-, medium-, or high-volume groups on the basis of the number of mammograms read per month. The standard binormal receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) model was fitted to the data of individual readers. Detection accuracy was measured by the sensitivity at specificity = 0.90, and differences among sensitivities were determined by analysis of variance. Results: The average sensitivity at specificity = 0.90 was 0.785 for U.K. radiologists, 0.756 for high-volume U.S. radiologists, 0.702 for medium-volume U.S. radiologists, and 0.648 for low-volume U.S. radiologists. At this specificity, low-volume U.S. radiologists had statistically significantly lower sensitivity than either high-volume U.S. radiologists or U.K. radiologists, and medium-volume U.S. radiologists had statistically significantly lower sensitivity than U.K. radiologists (P<.001, for all comparisons). Conclusions: Reader volume is an important determinant of mammogram sensitivity and specificity. High sensitivity (high cancer detection rate) can be achieved with high specificity (low false-positive rate) in high-volume centers. This study suggests that there is great potential for optimizing mammography screening.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in women between the ages of 15 and 54. During mammography screening, radiologists use a strict lexicon (BI-RADS) to describe and report their findings. Mammography records are then stored in a well-defined database format (NMD). Lately, researchers have applied data mining and machine learning techniques to these databases. They successfully built breast cancer classifiers that can help in early detection of malignancy. However, the validity of these models depends on the quality of the underlying databases. Unfortunately, most databases suffer from inconsistencies, missing data, inter-observer variability and inappropriate term usage. In addition, many databases are not compliant with the NMD format and/or solely consist of text reports. BI-RADS feature extraction from free text and consistency checks between recorded predictive variables and text reports are crucial to addressing this problem. We describe a general scheme for concept information retrieval from free text given a lexicon, and present a BI-RADS features extraction algorithm for clinical data mining. It consists of a syntax analyzer, a concept finder and a negation detector. The syntax analyzer preprocesses the input into individual sentences. The concept finder uses a semantic grammar based on the BI-RADS lexicon and the experts' input. It parses sentences detecting BI-RADS concepts. Once a concept is located, a lexical scanner checks for negation. Our method can handle multiple latent concepts within the text, filtering out ultrasound concepts. On our dataset, our algorithm achieves 97.7% precision, 95.5% recall and an F1-score of 0.97. It outperforms manual feature extraction at the 5% statistical significance level.},

abstract = {Breast parenchymal density has been found to be a strong indicator for breast cancer risk, however, to date, measures of breast density are qualitative and require the judgement of the radiologist. Objective, quantitative measures of breast density are crucial tools for assessing the association between the risk of breast cancer and mammographic density as well as for quantification of density changes to the breast. Various schemes have been proposed for classifying breast density patterns, though again each requires the judgement of the clinician to assign a particular region of tissue to its class and so it is time-consuming and prone to inter- and intra-radiologist disagreement. Motivated by recent results in texture classification, we present a new approach to breast parenchymal pattern classification. The proposed scheme uses texture models to capture the mammographic appearance within the breast area: parenchymal density patterns are modelled as a statistical distribution of clustered, rotationally invariant filter responses in a low dimensional space. This robust representation can accommodate large variations in intra-class mammogram appearance and can be trained in a straight-forward manner. Key to the approach is that parenchymal patterns can occupy disconnected regions in feature space. Objective descriptors of breast density based on the digital mammogram, are developed and validated.},

abstract = {Radiology reports contain information that can be mined using a search engine for teaching, research, and quality assurance purposes. Current search engines look for exact matches to the search term, but they do not differentiate between reports in which the search term appears in a positive context (i.e., being present) from those in which the search term appears in the context of negation and uncertainty. We describe RadReportMiner, a context-aware search engine, and compare its retrieval performance with a generic search engine, Google Desktop. We created a corpus of 464 radiology reports which described at least one of five findings (appendicitis, hydronephrosis, fracture, optic neuritis, and pneumonia). Each report was classified by a radiologist as positive (finding described to be present) or negative (finding described to be absent or uncertain). The same reports were then classified by RadReportMiner and Google Desktop. RadReportMiner achieved a higher precision (81%), compared with Google Desktop (27%; p < 0.0001). RadReportMiner had a lower recall (72%) compared with Google Desktop (87%; p = 0.006). We conclude that adding negation and uncertainty identification to a word-based radiology report search engine improves the precision of search results over a search engine that does not take this information into account. Our approach may be useful to adopt into current report retrieval systems to help radiologists to more accurately search for radiology reports.},

This valuable information is obtained by Fourier analysis of a small segment of a signal at a time. Localization of the Fourier spectrum is achieved by filtering the signal with frequency-dependent Gaussian scaling windows. This multi-scale time-frequency analysis provides information about which frequencies occur and more importantly when they occur. Furthermore, the Stockwell domain can be directly inferred from the Fourier domain and vice versa. These features make the ST a potentially effective tool to visualize, analyze, and process medical imaging data. The ST has proven useful in noise reduction and tissue texture analysis. Herein, we focus on the theory and effectiveness of the ST for medical imaging. Its effectiveness and comparison with other linear time-frequency transforms, such as the Gabor and wavelet transforms, are discussed and demonstrated using functional magnetic resonance imaging data.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:The objective of this study was to use mathematic models to aid mammography practices in interpreting outcomes data derived from a combination of screening and diagnostic examinations, and in interpreting diagnostic mammography outcomes data that are not segregated by indication for examination.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:We analyzed outcomes from 51,805 consecutive mammography examinations. Screening and diagnostic examinations were audited separately. Diagnostic examinations were audited by indication for examination. Extrapolating from our known mix of screening (79%) and diagnostic (21%) examinations, we determined expected combined outcomes for various mixes that might be encountered in clinical practice. Similarly, we determined the expected overall diagnostic mammography outcomes for various clinically relevant mixes of indications for examination.

RESULTS:Outcomes vary substantially depending on the mix of screening and diagnostic examinations performed. For example, expected outcomes for practices with screening-diagnostic mixes of 90-10% and 50-50% are, respectively: rate of abnormal findings, 6% versus 11%; rate of positive biopsy findings, 38% versus 42%; cancer detection rate, 10 per 1,000 versus 30 per 1,000; mean invasive cancer size, 14.4 mm versus 16.0 mm; nodal metastasis rate, 8% versus 11%; and rate of stage 0 and stage I cancers, 87% versus 82%. Diagnostic outcomes also vary substantially according to indication for examination, with a higher rate of abnormal findings, a higher rate of positive biopsy findings, and a larger mean invasive cancer size expected for mixes involving a high percentage of workups for palpable lesions.

CONCLUSION:When screening and diagnostic mammography outcomes are not segregated during auditing, and when diagnostic outcomes are not segregated by indication for examination, analysis of combined audit data should be based on extrapolations from known outcomes.},

We created a dataset of 79 CT images containing liver lesions identified and annotated by a radiologist using a controlled vocabulary of 76 semantic terms. Computationally-derived features were extracted describing intensity, texture, shape, and edge sharpness. Traditional logistic regression was compared to L(1)-regularized logistic regression (LASSO) in order to predict the radiological observations using computational features. The approach was evaluated by leave one out cross-validation. Informative radiological observations such as lesion enhancement, hypervascular attenuation, and homogeneous retention were predicted well by computational features. By exploiting relationships between computational and semantic features, this approach could lead to more accurate and efficient radiology reporting.},

abstract = {Concerns have been raised regarding the possible negative psychological impact of the cancer screening programmes offered in the UK. This review aims to assess the extent of and factors associated with the adverse psychological consequences of mammographic screening. Fifty-four papers from 13 countries were identified, a majority of which were published after 1990, coinciding more or less with the onset of routine mammographic screening. The results report that mammographic screening does not appear to create anxiety in women who are given a clear result after a mammogram and are subsequently placed on routine recall. However, women who have further investigations following their routine mammogram experience significant anxiety in the short term, and possibly in the long term. The nature and extent of the further investigation that women are exposed to during mammographic screening determines the intensity of the psychological impact. Factors associated with the adverse psychological impact of mammographic screening included: social demographic factors of younger age, lower education, living in urban areas, manual occupation, and one or no children; cancer screening factors of dissatisfaction with information and communication during screening process, waiting time between recall letter and recall appointment, pain experienced during the mammographic screening procedures, and previous false positive result; and cancer worry factors including fear of cancer and greater perceived risk of breast cancer. Difficulties in measuring the psychological impact of screening are discussed, and methods of alleviating the negative psychological outcomes are suggested.

We investigated whether the effects of false-positive mammograms on women's well-being are limited to outcomes specific to breast cancer. Methods: We searched MEDLINE for studies of the psychosocial effects of false-positive results of routine screening mammography. We pooled effect sizes using random effects meta-analysis. Results: Across 17 studies (n=20 781), receiving a false-positive mammogram the result was associated with differences in all eight breast-cancer-specific outcomes that we examined. These included greater anxiety and distress about breast cancer as well as more frequent breast self-exams and higher perceived effectiveness of screening mammography. False positives were associated with only one of six generic outcomes (i.e. generalized anxiety), and this effect size was small. Conclusions: False-positive mammograms influenced women's well-being, but the effects were limited to breast-cancer-specific outcomes. Researchers should include disease-specific measures in future studies of the consequences of false-positive mammograms. Copyright {\copyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives. The purpose of this study was to test whether computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can improve radiologists' performance in breast cancer diagnosis. Materials and Methods. The computer classification scheme used in this study estimates the likelihood of malignancy for clustered microcalcifications based on eight computer-extracted features obtained from standard-view mammograms. One hundred four histologically verified cases of microcalcifications (46 malignant, 58 benign) in a near-consecutive biopsy series were used in this study. Observer performance was measured on 10 radiologists who read the original standard and magnification-view mammograms. The computer aid provided a percentage estimate of the likelihood of malignancy. Comparison was made between computer-aided performance and unaided (routine clinical) performance by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and by comparing biopsy recommendations. Results. The average ROC curve area (Az) increased from 0.61 without aid to 0.75 with the computer aid (P {\&}lt; .0001). On average, with the computer aid, each observer recommended 6.4 additional biopsies for cases with malignant lesions (P = .0006) and 6.0 fewer biopsies for cases with benign lesions (P = .003). This improvement corresponded to increases in sensitivity (from 73.5% to 87.4), specificity (from 31.6% to 41.9%), and hypothetical positive biopsy yield (from 46% to 55%). Conclusion. CAD can be used to improve radiologists' performance in breast cancer diagnosis.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:Unlabeled medical image data are abundant, yet the process of converting them into a labeled ("truth-known") database is time and resource expensive and fraught with ethical and logistics issues. The authors propose a dual-stage CADx scheme in which both labeled and unlabeled (truth-known and "truth-unknown") data are used. This study is an initial exploration of the potential for leveraging unlabeled data toward enhancing breast CADx.

METHODS:From a labeled ultrasound image database consisting of 1126 lesions with an empirical cancer prevalence of 14%, 200 different randomly sampled subsets were selected and the truth status of a variable number of cases was masked to the algorithm to mimic different types of labeled and unlabeled data sources. The prevalence was fixed at 50% cancerous for the labeled data and 5% cancerous for the unlabeled. In the first stage of the dual-stage CADx scheme, the authors term "transductive dimension reduction regularization" (TDR-R), both labeled and unlabeled images characterized by extracted lesion features were combined using dimension reduction (DR) techniques and mapped to a lower-dimensional representation. (The first stage ignored truth status therefore was an unsupervised algorithm.) In the second stage, the labeled data from the reduced dimension embedding were used to train a classifier toward estimating the probability of malignancy. For the first CADx stage, the authors investigated three DR approaches: Laplacian eigen-maps, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and principal component analysis. For the TDR-R methods, the classifier in the second stage was a supervised (i.e., utilized truth) Bayesian neural net. The dual-stage CADx schemes were compared to a single-stage scheme based on manifold regularization (MR) in a semisupervised setting via the LapSVM algorithm. Performance in terms of areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of the CADx schemes was evaluated in leave-one-out and .632+ bootstrap analyses on a by-lesion basis. Additionally, the trained algorithms were applied to an independent test data set consisting of 101 lesions with approximately 50% cancer prevalence. The difference in AUC (deltaAUC) between with and without the use of unlabeled data was computed.

RESULTS:Statistically significant differences in the average AUC value (deltaAUC) were found in many instances between training with and without unlabeled data, based on the sample set distributions generated from this particular ultrasound data set during cross-validation and using independent test set. For example, when using 100 labeled and 900 unlabeled cases and testing on the independent test set, the TDR-R methods produced average deltaAUC=0.0361 with 95% intervals [0.0301; 0.0408] (p-value < 0.0001, adjusted for multiple comparisons, but considering the test set fixed) using t-SNE and average deltaAUC=.026 [0.0227, 0.0298] (adjusted p-value < 0.0001) using Laplacian eigenmaps, while the MR-based LapSVM produced an average deltaAUC=.0381 [0.0351; 0.0405] (adjusted p-value < 0.0001). The authors also found that schemes initially obtaining lower than average performance when using labeled data only showed the most prominent increase in performance when unlabeled data were added in the first CADx stage, suggesting a regularization effect due to the injection of unlabeled data.

CONCLUSION:The findings reveal evidence that incorporating unlabeled data information into the overall development of CADx methods may improve classifier performance by non-negligible amounts and warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:In this preliminary study, recently developed unsupervised nonlinear dimension reduction (DR) and data representation techniques were applied to computer-extracted breast lesion feature spaces across three separate imaging modalities: Ultrasound (U.S.) with 1126 cases, dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging with 356 cases, and full-field digital mammography with 245 cases. Two methods for nonlinear DR were explored: Laplacian eigenmaps [M. Belkin and P. Niyogi, "Laplacian eigenmaps for dimensionality reduction and data representation," Neural Comput. 15, 1373-1396 (2003)] and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) [L. van der Maaten and G. Hinton, "Visualizing data using t-SNE," J. Mach. Learn. Res. 9, 2579-2605 (2008)].

METHODS:These methods attempt to map originally high dimensional feature spaces to more human interpretable lower dimensional spaces while preserving both local and global information. The properties of these methods as applied to breast computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) were evaluated in the context of malignancy classification performance as well as in the visual inspection of the sparseness within the two-dimensional and three-dimensional mappings. Classification performance was estimated by using the reduced dimension mapped feature output as input into both linear and nonlinear classifiers: Markov chain Monte Carlo based Bayesian artificial neural network (MCMC-BANN) and linear discriminant analysis. The new techniques were compared to previously developed breast CADx methodologies, including automatic relevance determination and linear stepwise (LSW) feature selection, as well as a linear DR method based on principal component analysis. Using ROC analysis and 0.632+bootstrap validation, 95% empirical confidence intervals were computed for the each classifier's AUC performance.

RESULTS:In the large U.S. data set, sample high performance results include, AUC0.632+ = 0.88 with 95% empirical bootstrap interval [0.787;0.895] for 13 ARD selected features and AUC0.632+ = 0.87 with interval [0.817;0.906] for four LSW selected features compared to 4D t-SNE mapping (from the original 81D feature space) giving AUC0.632+ = 0.90 with interval [0.847;0.919], all using the MCMC-BANN.

CONCLUSIONS:Preliminary results appear to indicate capability for the new methods to match or exceed classification performance of current advanced breast lesion CADx algorithms. While not appropriate as a complete replacement of feature selection in CADx problems, DR techniques offer a complementary approach, which can aid elucidation of additional properties associated with the data. Specifically, the new techniques were shown to possess the added benefit of delivering sparse lower dimensional representations for visual interpretation, revealing intricate data structure of the feature space.},

abstract = {DESCRIPTION:Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for breast cancer in the general population.

METHODS:The USPSTF examined the evidence on the efficacy of 5 screening modalities in reducing mortality from breast cancer: film mammography, clinical breast examination, breast self-examination, digital mammography, and magnetic resonance imaging in order to update the 2002 recommendation. To accomplish this update, the USPSTF commissioned 2 studies: 1) a targeted systematic evidence review of 6 selected questions relating to benefits and harms of screening, and 2) a decision analysis that used population modeling techniques to compare the expected health outcomes and resource requirements of starting and ending mammography screening at different ages and using annual versus biennial screening intervals.

RECOMMENDATIONS:The USPSTF recommends against routine screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years. The decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take into account patient context, including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms. (Grade C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women between the ages of 50 and 74 years. (Grade B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of clinical breast examination beyond screening mammography in women 40 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF recommends against clinicians teaching women how to perform breast self-examination. (Grade D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess additional benefits and harms of either digital mammography or magnetic resonance imaging instead of film mammography as screening modalities for breast cancer.

Many cognitive biases are unconscious, and we assume they affect others more than ourselves. Radiologists should understand these limitations and seek methods to address them. A potential method is the checklist, which has been used to improve consistency and quality both outside and within medicine. Structured reporting can serve as a checklist and, although promising, has yet to widely demonstrate benefits.},

In order to do this, we review the common algorithms for resampling and methods for constructing bootstrap confidence intervals, together with some less well known ones, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

abstract = {In the problem of binary classification (or medical diagnosis), the classification rule (or diagnostic test) produces a continuous decision variable which is compared to a critical value (or threshold). Test values above (or below) that threshold are called positive (or negative) for disease. The two types of errors associated with every threshold value are Type I (false positive) and Type I I (false negative) errors. The Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) describes the relationship between probabilities of these two types of errors. The inverse problem is considered; i.e., given the ROC curve (or its estimate) of a particular classification rule, one is interested in finding the value of the threshold $\xi$ that leads to a specific operating point on that curve. A nonparametric method for estimating the threshold is proposed. Asymptotic distribution is derived for the proposed estimator. Results from simulated data and real-world data are presented for finite sample size. Finding a particular threshold value is crucial in medical diagnoses, among other fields, where a medical test is used to classify a patient as ``diseased'' or ``nondiseased'' based on comparing the test result to a particular threshold value. When the ROC is estimated, an operating point is obtained by fixing probability of one type of error, and obtaining the other one from the estimated curve. Threshold estimation can then be viewed as a quantile estimation for one distribution but with the utilization of the second one.},

Our algorithm differentiates itself from earlier work in that it uses a criterion that maximizes the lattice entropy reduction over the whole dataset. We introduce our criterion, show how it can be simplified and approximated, and describe the detailed algorithm to optimize the criterion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new algorithm with directory assistance data collected under the real usage scenarios and show that our new algorithm consistently outperforms the confidence based approach by a significant margin. Using the algorithm cuts the number of utterances needed for transcribing by 50% to achieve the same recognition accuracy obtained using the confidence-based approach, and by 60% compared to the random sampling approach.},

As researchers conducting separate studies in the United States, The Netherlands, and Australia, using similar qualitative methods to investigate implementing PCISs, the authors have encountered many instances in which PCIS applications seem to foster errors rather than reduce their likelihood. The authors describe the kinds of silent errors they have witnessed and, from their different social science perspectives (information science, sociology, and cognitive science), they interpret the nature of these errors. The errors fall into two main categories: those in the process of entering and retrieving information, and those in the communication and coordination process that the PCIS is supposed to support. The authors believe that with a heightened awareness of these issues, informaticians can educate, design systems, implement, and conduct research in such a way that they might be able to avoid the unintended consequences of these subtle silent errors.},

Is a thesaurus a tool to enrich a writer's style or an indexing tool used in bibliographic retrieval? Or can it be both? A literature study was to clear the confusion, but rather than giving us consensus definitions, it provided us with conflicting descriptions. We classified these definitions into three domains: linguistics, knowledge management and bibliographic retrieval. The scope of the terms is therefore highly dependent on the context. We propose one definition per term, per context. In addition to this intra-conceptual confusion, there is also inter-conceptual vagueness. This leads to the introduction of misnomers, like "ontology" in the Gene Ontology. We examined some important (bio)medical systems for their compatibility with the definitions proposed in the first part of this paper. To conclude, an overview of these systems and their classification into the three domains is given.},

This is an important question both for comparing models and for assessing a final selected model. The traditional answer to this question is given by cross-validation. The cross-validation estimate of prediction error is nearly unbiased but can be highly variable. Here we discuss bootstrap estimates of prediction error, which can be thought of as smoothed versions of cross-validation. We show that a particular bootstrap method, the .632+ rule, substantially outperforms cross-validation in a catalog of 24 simulation experiments. Besides providing point estimates, we also consider estimating the variability of an error rate estimate. All of the results here are nonparametric and apply to any possible prediction rule; however, we study only classification problems with 0-1 loss in detail. Our simulations include "smooth" prediction rules like Fisher's linear discriminant function and unsmooth ones like nearest neighbors.},

abstract = {Detecting differences in texture has been found to be useful in a variety of medical image analysis applications. One class of methods for texture estimation is based upon analysis of local frequency spectra produced by the S transform. Clinical applications have included detection of multiple sclerosis lesions and identification of brain tumor genotype. This paper describes a software application designed to detect texture differences in medical images, demonstrates and validates the ability of the technique to analyze magnetic resonance images obtained of an in vitro phantom with known textural features, and compares the results to alternative methods. Finally, some examples of texture analysis in several promising biomedical applications are included.},

The AMIA has defined translational bioinformatics as ``{\ldots} the development of storage, analytic, and interpretive methods to optimize the transformation of increasingly voluminous biomedical data into proactive, predictive, preventative, and participatory health.'' In this perspective, I will list eight reasons why this is an excellent time to be studying translational bioinformatics, including the significant increase in funding opportunities available for informatics from the United States National Institutes of Health, and the explosion of publicly-available data sets of molecular measurements. I end with the significant challenges we face in building a community of future investigators in Translational Bioinformatics.},

We developed and evaluated an algorithm called ConText, an extension of the NegEx negation algorithm, which relies on trigger terms, pseudo-trigger terms, and termination terms for identifying the values of three contextual features. In spite of its simplicity, ConText performed well at identifying negation and hypothetical status. ConText performed moderately at identifying whether a condition was experienced by someone other than the patient and whether the condition occurred historically.},

In this article, several notions of the multifold cross validation (MCV) method have been discussed. In the context of variable selection under a linear regression model, we show that the delete-d MCV criterion is asymptotically equivalent to the well known FPE criterion. Two computationally more feasible methods, the r-fold cross validation and the repeated learning-testing criterion, are also studied. The performance of these criteria are compared with the simple leave-one-out cross validation method. Simulation results are obtained to gain some understanding on the small sample properties of these methods.},

In this report we have applied an integrative approach to address the problem of identifying likely candidate genes within loci associated with human genetic diseases. Despite the recent progress in sequencing technologies, approaching this problem from an experimental perspective still represents a very demanding task, because the critical region may typically contain hundreds of positional candidates. We found that by concentrating only on genes sharing similar expression profiles in both human and mouse, massive microarray datasets can be used to reliably identify disease-relevant relationships among genes. Moreover, we found that integrating the coexpression criterion with systematic phenome analysis allows efficient identification of disease genes in large genomic regions. Using this approach on 850 OMIM loci characterized by unknown molecular basis, we propose high-probability candidates for 81 genetic diseases.</p>},

abstract = {Measures of decision sensitivity that have been applied to medical decision problems were examined. Traditional threshold proximity methods have recently been supple mented by probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and by entropy-based measures of sen sitivity. The authors propose a fourth measure based upon the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), which they believe superior both methodologically and prag matically. Both the traditional and the newly suggested sensitivity measures focus en tirely on the likelihood of decision change without attention to corresponding changes in payoff, which are often small. Consequently, these measures can dramatically over state problem sensitivity. EVPI, on the other hand, incorporates both the probability of a decision change and the marginal benefit of such a change into a single measure, and therefore provides a superior picture of problem sensitivity. To lend support to this contention, the authors revisit three problems from the literature and compare the results of sensitivity analyses using probabilistic, entropy-based, and EVPI-based mea sures. Key words: sensitivity analysis; expected value of perfect information. (Med Decis Making 1998;18:95-109)},

The system uses an imaging-specific information model called a Description Set to organize selected terms in a relational database. The system's expressiveness for reporting is enhanced by its ability to codify uncertainty about imaging observations and to represent explicit causal and associational relationships among imaging findings. The system promptly and automatically generates a text report that referring physicians are accustomed to receiving. Because the image report information is stored in a fully coded fashion, it can be used to provide real-time decision support to radiologists, to transmit coded imaging data to electronic patient record systems, to measure and improve radiologists' performance, and to index images by content.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To explore different user-interface designs for structured progress note entry, with a long-term goal of developing design guidelines for user interfaces where users select items from large medical vocabularies.

DESIGN:The authors created eight different prototypes of a pen-based progress-note-writing system called PEN-Ivory. Each prototype allows physicians to write patient progress notes using simple pen-based gestures such as circle, line-out, and scratch-out. The result of an interaction with PEN-Ivory is a progress note in English prose. The eight prototypes were designed in a principled way, so that they differ from one another in just one of three different user-interface characteristics.

MEASUREMENTS:Five of the eight prototypes were tested by measuring the time it took 15 users, each using a distinct prototype, to document three patient cases consisting of a total of 63 medical findings.

RESULTS:The prototype that allowed the fastest data entry had the following three user-interface characteristics: it used a paging rather than a scrolling form, it used a fixed palette of modifiers rather than a dynamic "pop-up" palette, and it made available all findings from the controlled vocabulary at once rather than displaying only a subset of findings generated by analyzing the patient's problem list.

CONCLUSION:Even simple design changes to a user interface can make dramatic differences in user performance. The authors discuss possible influences on performance, such as positional constancy, user uncertainty and system anticipation, that may contribute significantly to the effectiveness of systems that display menus of items from large controlled vocabularies of medicine.},

The input to the system is a free-text report from a radiologic study. The system requires no reporting style changes on the part of the radiologist. Statistical and machine learning methods are used extensively throughout the system. A graphical user interface has been developed that allows the creation of hand-tagged training examples. Various aspects of the difficult problem of implementing an automated structured reporting system have been addressed, and the relevant technology is progressing well. Extensible Markup Language is emerging as the preferred syntactic standard for representing and distributing these structured reports within a clinical environment. Early successes hold out hope that similar statistically based models of language will allow deep understanding of textual reports. The success of these statistical methods will depend on the availability of large numbers of high-quality training examples for each radiologic subdomain. The acceptability of automated structured reporting systems will ultimately depend on the results of comprehensive evaluations.},

In particular, we examine Pathfinder, a normative expert system that assists surgical pathologists with the diagnosis of lymph-node diseases, and discuss the representation of dependencies among pieces of evidence within this system. We describe the belief network, a graphical representation of probabilistic dependencies. We see how Pathfinder uses a belief network to construct differential diagnosis efficiently, even when there are dependencies among pieces of evidence. In addition, we introduce an extension of the belief-network representation called a similarity network, a tool for constructing large and complex belief networks. The representation allows a user to construct independent belief networks for subsets of a given domain. A valid belief network for the entire domain can then be constructed from the individual belief networks.

abstract = {Pathfinder is an expert system that assists surgical pathologists with the diagnosis of lymph-node diseases. The program is one of a growing number of normative expert systems that use probability and decision theory to acquire, represent, manipulate, and explain uncertain medical knowledge. In this article, we describe Pathfinder and our research in uncertain-reasoning paradigms that was stimulated by the development of the program. We discuss limitations with early decision-theoretic methods for reasoning under uncertainty and our initial attempts to use non-decision-theoretic methods. Then, we describe experimental and theoretical results that directed us to return to reasoning methods based in probability and decision theory.},

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate and compare the opinions and expectations regarding the radiology report of radiologists and referring clinicians and to identify trends, discordance, and discontent.Materials and Methods: A total of 3884 clinicians and 292 radiologists were invited by e-mail to participate in two internet surveys, COVER (for clinical specialists and general practitioners) and ROVER (for radiologists). Respondents were asked to state their level of agreement with 46 statements according to a Likert scale. Dichotomized results were compared by using the $\chi$2 statistic.Results: Eight hundred seventy-three completed forms were prepared for analysis, corresponding to a response rate of 21%. Most clinicians declared themselves satisfied with the radiology report. A large majority considered it an indispensable tool and accepted that the radiologist is the best person to interpret the images. Nearly all agreed that they need to provide adequate clinical information and state clearly what clinical question they want to have answered. Itemized reporting was preferred for complex examinations by both the clinicians and the radiologists. A majority in both groups were convinced that learning to report needs to be taught in a structured way.Conclusion: The surveys emphasize the role of the radiologist as a well-informed medical imaging specialist; however, some of the preferences of radiologists and clinicians diverge fundamentally from the way radiology is practiced and taught today, and implementing these preferences may have far-reaching consequences.{\copyright} RSNA, 2011},

Favorable interactions between disembodied amino acid residues and the target surface are identified and used to anchor de novo designed interfaces. The method was used to design proteins that bind a conserved surface patch on the stem of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) from the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus. After affinity maturation, two of the designed proteins, HB36 and HB80, bind H1 and H5 HAs with low nanomolar affinity. Further, HB80 inhibits the HA fusogenic conformational changes induced at low pH. The crystal structure of HB36 in complex with 1918/H1 HA revealed that the actual binding interface is nearly identical to that in the computational design model. Such designed binding proteins may be useful for both diagnostics and therapeutics.},

Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

In this paper the authors, who are among the chief designers of the RIM, respond to the major points that have been raised against the RIM in the published literature. We find that much of the criticism is based on misunderstandings and differences in point of view. We wish to advance the dialogue in the hope that when we account for those differences, effective critique may lead to real improvements of the standard.},

Dissecting the specific combination of factors that bind each target is a significant challenge. Here, we describe in detail the Allele Binding Cooperativity test, which uses variation in transcription factor binding among individuals to discover combinations of factors and their targets. We developed the ALPHABIT (a large-scale process to hunt for allele binding interacting transcription factors) pipeline, which includes statistical analysis of binding sites followed by experimental validation, and demonstrate that this method predicts transcription factors that associate with NF$\kappa$B. Our method successfully identifies factors that have been known to work with NF$\kappa$B (E2A, STAT1, IRF2), but whose global coassociation and sites of cooperative action were not known. In addition, we identify a unique coassociation (EBF1) that had not been reported previously. We present a general approach for discovering combinatorial models of regulation and advance our understanding of the genetic basis of variation in transcription factor binding.},

The health traits considered are both mutable (body mass index (BMI), smoking, blood pressure, body proportion, muscularity, and depression) and, for comparison, basically immutable (height, birth order, personality type, only child, and handedness); and the traits have varying degrees of observability. We test the hypotheses that existing ties (i.e. close friendship nominations) are more likely to dissolve between people with dissimilar (mutable and observable) health traits whereas new ties are more likely to form between those with similar (mutable and observable) traits while controlling for persons' age, gender, geographic separation, and education. The mixed effects models contain random effects for both the nominator (ego) and nominated (alter) persons in a tie to account for the fact that people were involved in multiple relationships and contributed observations at multiple exams. Results for BMI support the hypotheses that people of similar BMI are less likely to dissolve existing ties and more likely to form ties, while smoker to non-smoker ties were the least likely to dissolve and smoker to smoker ties were the most likely to form. We also validated previously known findings regarding homophily on age and gender, and found evidence that homophily also depends upon geographic separation.},

CDA, Release Two (CDA R2), became an ANSI-approved HL7 Standard in May 2005 and is the subject of this article, where the focus is primarily on how the standard has evolved since CDA R1, particularly in the area of semantic representation of clinical events. CDA is a document markup standard that specifies the structure and semantics of a clinical document (such as a discharge summary or progress note) for the purpose of exchange. A CDA document is a defined and complete information object that can include text, images, sounds, and other multimedia content. It can be transferred within a message and can exist independently, outside the transferring message. CDA documents are encoded in Extensible Markup Language (XML), and they derive their machine processable meaning from the RIM, coupled with terminology. The CDA R2 model is richly expressive, enabling the formal representation of clinical statements (such as observations, medication administrations, and adverse events) such that they can be interpreted and acted upon by a computer. On the other hand, CDA R2 offers a low bar for adoption, providing a mechanism for simply wrapping a non-XML document with the CDA header or for creating a document with a structured header and sections containing only narrative content. The intent is to facilitate widespread adoption, while providing a mechanism for incremental semantic interoperability.},

abstract = {Classification in bioinformatics often suffers from small samples in conjunction with large numbers of features, which makes error estimation problematic. When a sample is small, there is insufficient data to split the sample and the same data are used for both classifier design and error estimation. Error estimation can suffer from high variance, bias, or both. The problem of choosing a suitable error estimator is exacerbated by the fact that estimation performance depends on the rule used to design the classifier, the feature-label distribution to which the classifier is to be applied, and the sample size. This paper reviews the performance of training-sample error estimators with respect to several criteria: estimation accuracy, variance, bias, correlation with the true error, regression on the true error, and accuracy in ranking feature sets. A number of error estimators are considered: resubstitution, leave-one-out cross-validation, 10-fold cross-validation, bolstered resubstitution, semi-bolstered resubstitution, .632 bootstrap, .632{\&}{\#}43; bootstrap, and optimal bootstrap. It illustrates these performance criteria for certain models and for two real data sets, referring to the literature for more extensive applications of these criteria. The results given in the present paper are consistent with those in the literature and lead to two conclusions: (1) much greater effort needs to be focused on error estimation, and (2) owing to the generally poor performance of error estimators on small samples, for a conclusion based on a small-sample error estimator to be considered valid, it should be supported by evidence that the estimator in question can be expected to perform sufficiently well under the circumstances to justify the conclusion. <P></P> <P></P> <P></P>},

abstract = {SUMMARY:Bayesian Networks (BNs) are versatile probabilistic models applicable to many different biological phenomena. In biological applications the structure of the network is usually unknown and needs to be inferred from experimental data. BNFinder is a fast software implementation of an exact algorithm for finding the optimal structure of the network given a number of experimental observations. Its second version, presented in this article, represents a major improvement over the previous version. The improvements include (i) a parallelized learning algorithm leading to an order of magnitude speed-ups in BN structure learning time; (ii) inclusion of an additional scoring function based on mutual information criteria; (iii) possibility of choosing the resulting network specificity based on statistical criteria and (iv) a new module for classification by BNs, including cross-validation scheme and classifier quality measurements with receiver operator characteristic scores.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether adding diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) could improve the positive predictive value (PPV) of breast MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The retrospective study included 70 women with 83 suspicious breast lesions on DCE-MRI (BI-RADS 4 or 5) who underwent subsequent biopsy. DWI was acquired during clinical breast MRI using b = 0 and 600 s/mm2. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were compared for benign and malignant lesions. PPV was calculated for DCE-MRI alone (based on biopsy recommendations) and DCE-MRI plus DWI (adding an ADC threshold) for the same set of lesions. Results were further compared by lesion type (mass, nonmasslike enhancement) and size. RESULTS. Of the 83 suspicious lesions, 52 were benign and 31 were malignant (11 ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS], 20 invasive carcinoma). Both DCIS (mean ADC, 1.31 $\pm$ 0.24 ? 10?3 mm2/s) and invasive carcinoma (mean ADC, 1.29 $\pm$ 0.29 ? 10?3 mm2/s) exhibited lower mean ADC than benign lesions (1.70 $\pm$ 0.44 ? 10?3 mm2/s, p < 0.001). Applying an ADC threshold of 1.81 ? 10?3 mm2/s for 100% sensitivity produced a PPV of 47% versus 37% for DCE-MRI alone, which would have avoided biopsy for 33% (17/52) of benign lesions without missing any cancers. DWI increased PPV similarly for masses and nonmasslike enhancement and preferentially improved PPV for smaller (≤ 1 cm) versus larger lesions. CONCLUSION. DWI shows potential for improving the PPV of breast MRI for lesions of varied types and sizes. However, considerable overlap in ADC of benign and malignant lesions necessitates validation of these findings in larger studies.},

Evaluation of metastases with different imaging modalities in patients with cancer or examination of multiple artery segments in patients with heart abnormalities are some examples of such studies. Data obtained from multiple observations per patient are cluster correlated and should not be analyzed by using standard statistical methods because of correlations within a subject. In this article, positron emission tomographic studies are used as a framework to review statistical methods for the analysis of clustered data. Some simple statistical methods that account for correlation within a subject and that can be applied to conventional and well-known statistical methods, such as the $\chi$2 and t tests, are introduced. One of these methods is illustrated by using a brief analysis of data from a positron emission tomographic study, which demonstrates how resulting conclusions may be incorrect ...},

abstract = {Medical knowledge is growing at an explosive rate. While the availability of pertinent data has the potential to make the task of diagnosis more accurate, it is also increasingly overwhelming for physicians to assimilate. Using artificial intelligence techniques, a computer can process large amounts of data to help physicians manage the growing body of medical knowledge and thereby make better decisions. Computer-assisted diagnosis support is of particular interest to the diagnostic imaging community because radiologists must integrate huge amounts of data in order to diagnose disease. Bayesian networks, among the most promising artificial intelligence techniques available, enable computers to store knowledge and estimate the probability of outcomes based on probability theory. The article describes what a Bayesian network is and how it works using a system in mammography for illustration. A comparison of Bayesian networks with other types of artificial intelligence methods, specifically neural networks and case-based reasoning, clarifies the unique features and the potential of these systems to aid radiologists in the decisions they make every day.},

abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. A total of 1,638,910 new cancer cases and 577,190 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2012. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2004-2008), overall cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8% per year in men and by 1.6% per year in women. Over the past 10 years of available data (1999-2008), cancer death rates have declined by more than 1% per year in men and women of every racial/ethnic group with the exception of American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom rates have remained stable. The most rapid declines in death rates occurred among African American and Hispanic men (2.4% and 2.3% per year, respectively). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate), with lung cancer accounting for almost 40% of the total decline in men and breast cancer accounting for 34% of the total decline in women. The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of about 1,024,400 deaths from cancer. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket.

Throughout much of the 20th century, physicians showed little interesting in using x-rays to help diagnose breast cancer. But beginning in the 1960s, with the growing interest in early detection, the professionalization of radiology and cancer activism, and the increasing allure of visual imagery in medicine, screening mammograms became the centerpiece of efforts to lower mortality from breast cancer. Despite its popularity, however, mammography remains highly controversial as physicians, statisticians and the public have continued to debate its actual clinical value. Mammography well exemplifies how cultural, ideological and political factors influence both the dissemination and evaluation of medical technologies.},

This project provided 5 years of screening with physical examination and two-view mammography for 280,000 volunteer women across the United States. Based on a 96% follow-up from 1993 to 1995 of the 4,051 women with breast cancer available for analysis, 2,658 (66%) were alive and 1,393 (34%) were dead. A high proportion of the cancers were detected by mammography alone, and 28.6% of all the cancers were smaller than 1.0 cm. Survival rates were calculated by life table method with deaths from breast cancer as the outcome. The adjusted survival rate for the entire group was 80.5%, and the observed survival rate was 61.7%. Adjusted and observed survival rates were 97.2% and 78.5%, respectively, for women with non-invasive cancers and 78.2% and 59.3%, respectively, for those with invasive cancers. Lymph node status and the size of the cancer at diagnosis were prognostic indicators of survival in the BCDDP Women with invasive cancers and negative lymph nodes had an 85.5% breast cancer survival rate and a 65.6% observed survival rate. Adjusted survival rates for women with invasive breast cancers were 90.2% for cancers smaller than 1 cm, 80.5%, for cancers 1.0 to 1.9 cm, 70.5% for cancers 2.0 to 4.9 cm, and 60.6% for cancers larger than 5 cm. Women 40 to 49 years of age demonstrated a greater survival with noninvasive or invasive cancers smaller than 5.0 cm compared with women 50 to 59 and 60 to 69 years of age at diagnosis. These results from the BCDDP are discussed in the context of the recent decline in breast cancer incidence and mortality in the United States.},

Its strengths lie in the ease with which it is produced and the transparency of its definition. While visually appealing, major long-noted shortcomings lie in the difficulty of interpreting the graph visually; for the most part, ambiguities arise from variations in the distributions of forecast probabilities and from various binning procedures. A resampling method for assigning consistency bars to the observed frequencies is introduced that allows for immediate visual evaluation as to just how likely the observed relative frequencies are under the assumption that the predicted probabilities are reliable. Further, an alternative presentation of the same information on probability paper eases quantitative evaluation and comparison. Both presentations can easily be employed for any method of binning.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:A 2% threshold, traditionally used as a level above which breast biopsy recommended, has been generalized to all patients from several specific situations analyzed in the literature. We use a sequential decision analytic model considering clinical and mammography features to determine the optimal general threshold for image guided breast biopsy and the sensitivity of this threshold to variation of these features.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:We built a decision analytical model called a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model, which determines the optimal threshold of breast cancer risk to perform breast biopsy in order to maximize a patient's total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The optimal biopsy threshold is determined based on a patient's probability of breast cancer estimated by a logistic regression model (LRM) which uses demographic risk factors (age, family history, and hormone use) and mammographic findings (described using the established lexicon-BI-RADS). We estimate the MDP model's parameters using SEER data (prevalence of invasive vs. in situ disease, stage at diagnosis, and survival), US life tables (all cause mortality), and the medical literature (biopsy disutility and treatment efficacy) to determine the optimal "base case" risk threshold for breast biopsy and perform sensitivity analysis. The base case MDP model reveals that 2% is the optimal threshold for breast biopsy for patients between 42 and 75 however the thresholds below age 42 is lower (1%) and above age 75 is higher (range of 3-5%). Our sensitivity analysis reveals that the optimal biopsy threshold varies most notably with changes in age and disutility of biopsy.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:Our MDP model validates the 2% threshold currently used for biopsy but shows this optimal threshold varies substantially with patient age and biopsy disutility.},

After its beginnings as a technology advocated by computer scientists to overcome problems of heterogeneity, ontology has been taken up by biologists themselves as a means to consistently annotate features from genotype to phenotype. In medical informatics, artifacts called ontologies have been used for a longer period of time to produce controlled lexicons for coding schemes. In this article, we review the current position in ontologies and how they have become institutionalized within biomedicine. As the field has matured, the much older philosophical aspects of ontology have come into play. With this and the institutionalization of ontology has come greater formality. We review this trend and what benefits it might bring to ontologies and their use within biomedicine.},

abstract = {The technology revolution in image acquisition, instrumentation, and methods has resulted in vast data sets that far outstrip the human observers' ability to view, digest, and interpret modern medical images by using traditional methods. This may require a paradigm shift in the radiologic interpretation process. As human observers, radiologists must search for, detect, and interpret targets. Potential interventions should be based on an understanding of human perceptual and attentional abilities and limitations. New technologies and tools already in use in other fields can be adapted to the health care environment to improve medical image analysis, visualization, and navigation through large data sets. This historical psychophysical and technical review touches on a broad range of disciplines but focuses mainly on the analysis, visualization, and navigation of image data performed during the interpretive process. Advanced postprocessing, including three-dimensional image display, multimodality image fusion, quantitative measures, and incorporation of innovative human-machine interfaces, will likely be the future. Successful new paradigms will integrate image and nonimage data, incorporate workflow considerations, and be informed by evidence-based practices. This overview is meant to heighten the awareness of the complexities and limitations of how radiologists interact with images, particularly the large image sets generated today. Also addressed is how human-machine interface and informatics technologies could combine to transform the interpretation process in the future to achieve safer and better quality care for patients and a more efficient and effective work environment for radiologists.{\copyright} RSNA, 2011Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11091276/-/DC1},

abstract = {Biomedical research is increasingly a data-driven science. New technologies support the generation of genome-scale data sets of sequences, sequence variants, transcripts, and proteins; genetic elements underpinning understanding of biomedicine and disease. Information systems designed to manage these data, and the functional insights (biological knowledge) that come from the analysis of these data, are critical to mining large, heterogeneous data sets for new biologically relevant patterns, to generating hypotheses for experimental validation, and ultimately, to building models of how biological systems work. Bio-ontologies have an essential role in supporting two key approaches to effective interpretation of genome-scale data sets: data integration and comparative genomics. To date, bio-ontologies such as the Gene Ontology have been used primarily in community genome databases as structured controlled terminologies and as data aggregators. In this paper we use the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database as use cases to illustrate the impact of bio-ontologies on data integration and for comparative genomics. Despite the profound impact ontologies are having on the digital categorization of biological knowledge, new biomedical research and the expanding and changing nature of biological information have limited the development of bio-ontologies to support dynamic reasoning for knowledge discovery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Real-time convection-enhanced delivery (RCD) of adeno-associated viral vectors by co-infusion of gadoteridol allows T1 magnetic resonance imaging (T1 MRI) prediction of areas of subsequent gene expression. The use of T2 MRI in RCD is less developed. In addition, the effect of flushing a dead-space volume on subsequent distribution of a therapeutic agent is not known.

OBJECTIVE:The value of T2 MRI in RCD was investigated by comparing distribution volumes of saline with immediately after T1 RCD of gadoteridol and by comparing T2, T1, and transgene distribution patterns after viral vector RCD.

METHODS:Adult nonhuman primates underwent saline infusion/T2 acquisition, immediately followed by gadoteridol infusion/T1 acquisition in the putamen and brainstem. Distribution volumes and spatial patterns were analyzed. Gadoteridol and adeno-associated virus encoding human aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AAV2-hAADC) were co-infused under alternating T2/T1 acquisition in the thalamus, and hyperintense areas were compared with areas of subsequent transgene expression.

RESULTS:Ratios of distribution volume to infusion volume were similar between saline and gadoteridol RCD. Spatial overlap correlated well between T2 and T1 images. The second infusate followed a spatiotemporal pattern similar to that of the first, filling the target area before developing extra-target distribution. Areas of human L-amino acid decarboxylase expression correlated well with areas of both T1 and T2 hyperintensity observed during RCD.

CONCLUSION:Accuracy of cannula placement and initial infusate distribution may be safely determined by saline infusion without significantly altering the subsequent distribution of the tracer agent. T2 RCD provides detection of intraparenchymal convection- enhanced delivery in the uninjured brain and may predict subsequent distribution of a transgene after viral vector infusion.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this study was to compare the error rates in breast imaging reports generated with automated speech recognition (ASR) technology as opposed to conventional dictation transcription.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Breast imaging reports reviewed from January 2009 to April 2010 during multidisciplinary tumor board meetings at two hospitals were scrutinized for minor and major errors.

RESULTS:Of 615 reports obtained, 308 were generated with ASR and 307 with conventional dictation transcription. At least one major error was found in 23% of ASR reports, as opposed to 4% of conventional dictation transcription reports (p < 0.01). Major errors were more common in breast MRI reports (35% of ASR and 7% of conventional reports), the lowest error rates occurring in reports of interventional procedures (13% of ASR and 4% of conventional reports) and mammography reports (15% of ASR and no conventional reports) (p < 0.01). The error rates did not differ substantially between reports generated by staff radiologists and trainees or between reports generated by speakers who spoke English as their first language and those whose native language was not English. After adjustment for academic rank, native language, and imaging modality, reports generated with ASR were 8 times as likely as conventional dictation transcription reports to contain major errors (p < 0.01).

CONCLUSION:Reports generated with ASR are associated with higher error rates than reports generated with conventional dictation transcription. The imaging modality used is a predictor of the occurrence of reporting errors. Conversely, native language and academic rank of the speaker do not have a significant influence on error rate.},

In some instances, this task is difficult or impossible because of atypical clinical presentation or histopathology. To determine whether the diagnosis of multiple common adult malignancies could be achieved purely by molecular classification, we subjected 218 tumor samples, spanning 14 common tumor types, and 90 normal tissue samples to oligonucleotide microarray gene expression analysis. The expression levels of 16,063 genes and expressed sequence tags were used to evaluate the accuracy of a multiclass classifier based on a support vector machine algorithm. Overall classification accuracy was 78%, far exceeding the accuracy of random classification (9%). Poorly differentiated cancers resulted in low-confidence predictions and could not be accurately classified according to their tissue of origin, indicating that they are molecularly distinct entities with dramatically different gene expression patterns compared with their well differentiated counterparts. Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of accurate, multiclass molecular cancer classification and suggest a strategy for future clinical implementation of molecular cancer diagnostics.},

We collected and analyzed 40 published cancer microarray data sets, comprising 38 million gene expression measurements from >3,700 cancer samples. From this, we characterized a common transcriptional profile that is universally activated in most cancer types relative to the normal tissues from which they arose, likely reflecting essential transcriptional features of neoplastic transformation. In addition, we characterized a transcriptional profile that is commonly activated in various types of undifferentiated cancer, suggesting common molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells progress and avoid differentiation. Finally, we validated these transcriptional profiles on independent data sets.},

abstract = {We are all faced with uncertainty about the future, but we can get the measure of some uncertainties in terms of probabilities. Probabilities are notoriously difficult to communicate effectively to lay audiences, and in this review we examine current practice for communicating uncertainties visually, using examples drawn from sport, weather, climate, health, economics, and politics. Despite the burgeoning interest in infographics, there is limited experimental evidence on how different types of visualizations are processed and understood, although the effectiveness of some graphics clearly depends on the relative numeracy of an audience. Fortunately, it is increasingly easy to present data in the form of interactive visualizations and in multiple types of representation that can be adjusted to user needs and capabilities. Nonetheless, communicating deeper uncertainties resulting from incomplete or disputed knowledge---or from essential indeterminacy about the future---remains a challenge.},

abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

abstract = {The value of any kind of data is greatly enhanced when it exists in a form that allows it to be integrated with other data. One approach to integration is through the annotation of multiple bodies of data using common controlled vocabularies or 'ontologies'. Unfortunately, the very success of this approach has led to a proliferation of ontologies, which itself creates obstacles to integration. The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) consortium is pursuing a strategy to overcome this problem. Existing OBO ontologies, including the Gene Ontology, are undergoing coordinated reform, and new ontologies are being created on the basis of an evolving set of shared principles governing ontology development. The result is an expanding family of ontologies designed to be interoperable and logically well formed and to incorporate accurate representations of biological reality. We describe this OBO Foundry initiative and provide guidelines for those who might wish to become involved.},

abstract = {Registration is an important component of medical image analysis and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have fully automatic registration methods. Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage.},

As with any health care intervention, such claims require confirmation in clinical trials.Objectives  To review controlled trials assessing the effects of computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and to identify study characteristics predicting benefit.Data Sources  We updated our earlier reviews by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Inspec, and ISI databases and consulting reference lists through September 2004. Authors of 64 primary studies confirmed data or provided additional information.Study Selection  We included randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect of a CDSS compared with care provided without a CDSS on practitioner performance or patient outcomes.Data Extraction  Teams of 2 reviewers independently abstracted data on methods, setting, CDSS and patient characteristics, and outcomes.Data Synthesis  One hundred studies met our inclusion criteria. The number and methodologic quality of studies improved over time. The CDSS improved practitioner performance in 62 (64%) of the 97 studies assessing this outcome, including 4 (40%) of 10 diagnostic systems, 16 (76%) of 21 reminder systems, 23 (62%) of 37 disease management systems, and 19 (66%) of 29 drug-dosing or prescribing systems. Fifty-two trials assessed 1 or more patient outcomes, of which 7 trials (13%) reported improvements. Improved practitioner performance was associated with CDSSs that automatically prompted users compared with requiring users to activate the system (success in 73% of trials vs 47%; P = .02) and studies in which the authors also developed the CDSS software compared with studies in which the authors were not the developers (74% success vs 28%; respectively, P = .001).Conclusions  Many CDSSs improve practitioner performance. To date, the effects on patient outcomes remain understudied and, when studied, inconsistent.},

abstract = {The morphological interpretation of histologic sections forms the basis of diagnosis and prognostication for cancer. In the diagnosis of carcinomas, pathologists perform a semiquantitative analysis of a small set of morphological features to determine the cancer's histologic grade. Physicians use histologic grade to inform their assessment of a carcinoma's aggressiveness and a patient's prognosis. Nevertheless, the determination of grade in breast cancer examines only a small set of morphological features of breast cancer epithelial cells, which has been largely unchanged since the 1920s. A comprehensive analysis of automatically quantitated morphological features could identify characteristics of prognostic relevance and provide an accurate and reproducible means for assessing prognosis from microscopic image data. We developed the C-Path (Computational Pathologist) system to measure a rich quantitative feature set from the breast cancer epithelium and stroma (6642 features), including both standard morphometric descriptors of image objects and higher-level contextual, relational, and global image features. These measurements were used to construct a prognostic model. We applied the C-Path system to microscopic images from two independent cohorts of breast cancer patients [from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) cohort, n = 248, and the Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) cohort, n = 328]. The prognostic model score generated by our system was strongly associated with overall survival in both the NKI and the VGH cohorts (both log-rank P ≤ 0.001). This association was independent of clinical, pathological, and molecular factors. Three stromal features were significantly associated with survival, and this association was stronger than the association of survival with epithelial characteristics in the model. These findings implicate stromal morphologic structure as a previously unrecognized prognostic determinant for breast cancer.},

Using the concepts of decision analysis, we have derived expressions for two threshold probabilities involved in this choice: a "testing" threshold and a "test-treatment" threshold. Values can be assigned to these thresholds from data on the reliability and potential risks of the diagnostic test and the benefits and risks of a specific treatment. Treatment should be withheld if the probability of disease is smaller than the testing threshold, and treatment should be given without further testing if the probability of disease is greater than the test-treatment threshold. The test should be performed (with treatment depending on the test outcome) only if the probability of disease is between the two thresholds. The method exposes important principles of decision making and helps the clinician develop a rational, quantitative approach to the use of diagnostic tests.},

abstract = {Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate interobserver variability between breast radiologists by using terminology of the fourth edition of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) to categorize lesions on mammograms and sonograms and to retrospectively determine the positive predictive value (PPV) of BI-RADS categories 4a, 4b, and 4c.Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval was obtained; informed consent was not required. This study was HIPAA compliant. Ninety-four consecutive lesions in 91 women who underwent image-guided biopsy comprised 59 masses, 32 calcifications, and three masses with calcification. Five radiologists retrospectively reviewed these lesions. Each observer described each lesion with BI-RADS terminology and assigned a final BI-RADS category. Interobserver variability was assessed with the Cohen $\kappa$ statistic. A pathologic diagnosis was available for all 94 lesions; 30 (32%) were malignant and 64 (68%) were benign. Pathologic analysis of benign lesions was performed on tissue obtained with image-guided core-needle biopsy. In cases referred for excisional biopsy after needle biopsy because of atypia or discordance, final surgical pathologic analysis was used for correlation with imaging findings. PPV for category 4 or 5 lesions was determined for all readers combined.Results: For ultrasonographic (US) descriptors, substantial agreement was obtained for lesion orientation, shape, and boundary ($\kappa$ = 0.61, 0.66, and 0.69, respectively). Moderate agreement was obtained for lesion margin and posterior acoustic features ($\kappa$ = 0.40 for both). Fair agreement was obtained for lesion echo pattern ($\kappa$ = 0.29). For mammographic descriptors, moderate agreement was obtained for mass shape, mass margin, and calcification distribution ($\kappa$ = 0.48, 0.48, and 0.50, respectively). Fair agreement was obtained for calcification description ($\kappa$ = 0.32). Slight agreement was obtained for mass density ($\kappa$ = 0.18). Fair agreement was obtained for final assessment category ($\kappa$ = 0.28). PPVs of BI-RADS category 4 and 5 assignments were as follows: category 4a, six (6%) of 102; category 4b, 17 (15%) of 110; category 4c, 48 (53%) of 91; and category 5, 71 (91%) of 78.Conclusion: Interobserver agreement with the new BI-RADS terminology is good and validates the US lexicon. Subcategories 4a, 4b, and 4c are useful in predicting the likelihood of malignancy.{\copyright} RSNA, 2006},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate whether computer-aided diagnosis can reduce interobserver variability in the interpretation of mammograms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten radiologists interpreted mammograms showing clustered microcalcifications in 104 patients. Decisions for biopsy or follow-up were made with and without a computer aid, and these decisions were compared. The computer was used to estimate the likelihood that a microcalcification cluster was due to a malignancy. Variability in the radiologists' recommendations for biopsy versus follow-up was then analyzed.RESULTS: Variation in the radiologists' accuracy, as measured with the SD of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was reduced by 46% with computer aid. Access to the computer aid increased the agreement among all observers from 13% to 32% of the total cases (P < .001), while the $\kappa$ value increased from 0.19 to 0.41 (P < .05). Use of computer aid eliminated two-thirds of the substantial disagreements in which two radiologists recommended biopsy and routine screening in the same patient (P < .05).CONCLUSION: In addition to its demonstrated potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, computer-aided diagnosis has the potential to reduce the variability among radiologists in the interpretation of mammograms.},

abstract = {A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or "pixels", each pixel having a particular "colour" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a non-degenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable large-scale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly.},

abstract = {Most induction algorithms for building predictive models take as input training data in the form of feature vectors. Acquiring the values of features may be costly, and simply acquiring all values may be wasteful or prohibitively expensive. Active feature-value acquisition (AFA) selects features incrementally in an attempt to improve the predictive model most cost-effectively. This paper presents a framework for AFA based on estimating information value. Although straightforward in principle, estimations and approximations must be made to apply the framework in practice. We present an acquisition policy, sampled expected utility (SEU), that employs particular estimations to enable effective ranking of potential acquisitions in settings where relatively little information is available about the underlying domain. We then present experimental results showing that, compared with the policy of using representative sampling for feature acquisition, SEU reduces the cost of producing a model of a desired accuracy and exhibits consistent performance across domains. We also extend the framework to a more general modeling setting in which feature values as well as class labels are missing and are costly to acquire.},

Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) techniques could be valuable to radiologists in assessing medical images by identifying similar images in large archives that could assist with decision support. Many advances have occurred in CBIR, and a variety of systems have appeared in nonmedical domains; however, permeation of these methods into radiology has been limited. Our goal in this review is to survey CBIR methods and systems from the perspective of application to radiology and to identify approaches developed in nonmedical applications that could be translated to radiology. Radiology images pose specific challenges compared with images in the consumer domain; they contain varied, rich, and often subtle features that need to be recognized in assessing image similarity. Radiology images also provide rich opportunities for CBIR: rich metadata about image semantics are provided by radiologists, and this information is not yet being used to its fullest advantage in CBIR systems. By integrating pixel-based and metadata-based image feature analysis, substantial advances of CBIR in medicine could ensue, with CBIR systems becoming an important tool in radiology practice.},

abstract = {Radiology images are generally disconnected from the metadata describing their contents, such as imaging observations ("semantic" metadata), which are usually described in text reports that are not directly linked to the images. We developed a system, the Biomedical Image Metadata Manager (BIMM) to (1) address the problem of managing biomedical image metadata and (2) facilitate the retrieval of similar images using semantic feature metadata. Our approach allows radiologists, researchers, and students to take advantage of the vast and growing repositories of medical image data by explicitly linking images to their associated metadata in a relational database that is globally accessible through a Web application. BIMM receives input in the form of standard-based metadata files using Web service and parses and stores the metadata in a relational database allowing efficient data query and maintenance capabilities. Upon querying BIMM for images, 2D regions of interest (ROIs) stored as metadata are automatically rendered onto preview images included in search results. The system's "match observations" function retrieves images with similar ROIs based on specific semantic features describing imaging observation characteristics (IOCs). We demonstrate that the system, using IOCs alone, can accurately retrieve images with diagnoses matching the query images, and we evaluate its performance on a set of annotated liver lesion images. BIMM has several potential applications, e.g., computer-aided detection and diagnosis, content-based image retrieval, automating medical analysis protocols, and gathering population statistics like disease prevalences. The system provides a framework for decision support systems, potentially improving their diagnostic accuracy and selection of appropriate therapies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:(a) To determine the extent and range of errors and issues in the Systematised Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) hierarchies as they affect two practical projects. (b) To determine the origin of issues raised and propose methods to address them.

METHODS:The hierarchies for concepts in the Core Problem List Subset published by the Unified Medical Language System were examined for their appropriateness in two applications. Anomalies were traced to their source to determine whether they were simple local errors, systematic inferences propagated by SNOMED's classification process, or the result of problems with SNOMED's schemas. Conclusions were confirmed by showing that altering the root cause and reclassifying had the intended effects, and not others.

MAIN RESULTS:Major problems were encountered, involving concepts central to medicine including myocardial infarction, diabetes, and hypertension. Most of the issues raised were systematic. Some exposed fundamental errors in SNOMED's schemas, particularly with regards to anatomy. In many cases, the root cause could only be identified and corrected with the aid of a classifier.

LIMITATIONS:This is a preliminary 'experiment of opportunity.' The results are not exhaustive; nor is consensus on all points definitive.

CONCLUSIONS:The SNOMED CT hierarchies cannot be relied upon in their present state in our applications. However, systematic quality assurance and correction are possible and practical but require sound techniques analogous to software engineering and combined lexical and semantic techniques. Until this is done, anyone using SNOMED codes should exercise caution. Errors in the hierarchies, or attempts to compensate for them, are likely to compromise interoperability and meaningful use.},

abstract = {The classification of 3 common breast lesions, fibroadenomas, cysts, and cancers, was achieved using computerized image analysis of tumor shape in conjunction with patient age. The process involved the digitization of 69 mammographic images using a video camera and a commercial frame grabber on a PC-based computer system. An interactive segmentation procedure identified the tumor boundary using a thresholding technique which successfully segmented 57% of the lesions. Several features were chosen based on the gross and fine shape describing properties of the tumor boundaries as seen on the radiographs. Patient age was included as a significant feature in determining whether the tumor was a cyst, fibroadenoma, or cancer and was the only patient history information available for this study. The concept of a radial length measure provided a basis from which 6 of the 7 shape describing features were chosen, the seventh being tumor circularity. The feature selection process was accomplished using linear discriminant analysis and a Euclidean distance metric determined group membership. The effectiveness of the classification scheme was tested using both the apparent and the leaving-one-out test methods. The best results using the apparent test method resulted in correctly classifying 82% of the tumors segmented using the entire feature space and the highest classification rate using the leaving-one-out test method was 69% using a subset of the feature space. The results using only the shape descriptors, and excluding patient age resulted in correctly classifying 72% using the entire feature space (except age), and 51% using a subset of the feature space},

Structured reporting was created in the hopes of addressing well- documented deficiencies in report content and organiza- tion but has largely failed in its adoption due to concerns over workflow and productivity. A number of political, economical, and clinical quality-centric initiatives are currently taking place within medicine which will dramat- ically change the medical landscape including Pay for Performance, Evidence-Based Medicine, and the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative. These will collectively enhance efforts to improve quality in reporting, stimulate new technology development, and counteract the impending threat of commoditization within radiology. Structured reporting offers a number of unique opportunities and advantages over traditional free text reporting and will provide a means for the radiology community to add value to its most important service deliverable the radiology report.},

abstract = {The blood supplies of nodular lesions associated with liver cirrhosis were analyzed in vivo with various imaging modalities. The portal blood supply was evaluated with computed tomography (CT) during arterial portography (CTAP); the arterial blood supply was evaluated with hepatic angiography, CT angiography, CT following intraarterial injection of iodized oil, or ultrasound following intraarterial injection of carbon dioxide microbubbles. A total of 84 surgically confirmed hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (less than or equal to 3 cm) and 25 areas of adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) were included in the study. At CTAP, a portal blood supply was seen in 96% of cases of AH and only 6% of HCCs (chi 2, P less than .005). In contrast, an arterial supply greater than that of the surrounding liver was verified in 94% of the HCCs and only 4% of the cases of AH (chi 2, P less than .005). The blood supply of areas of AH with atypical hepatocytes and the blood supply of well-differentiated HCCs (Edmondson grade 1) tended to be intermediate between that of AH without atypia and that of HCC that was Edmondson and Steiner grade 2 or greater. Evaluation of the blood supply of the nodular lesions associated with liver cirrhosis is considered to be useful in the differential diagnosis and treatment of early-stage HCC.},

abstract = {Our knowledge of species and functional composition of the human gut microbiome is rapidly increasing, but it is still based on very few cohorts and little is known about variation across the world. By combining 22 newly sequenced faecal metagenomes of individuals from four countries with previously published data sets, here we identify three robust clusters (referred to as enterotypes hereafter) that are not nation or continent specific. We also confirmed the enterotypes in two published, larger cohorts, indicating that intestinal microbiota variation is generally stratified, not continuous. This indicates further the existence of a limited number of well-balanced host-microbial symbiotic states that might respond differently to diet and drug intake. The enterotypes are mostly driven by species composition, but abundant molecular functions are not necessarily provided by abundant species, highlighting the importance of a functional analysis to understand microbial communities. Although individual host properties such as body mass index, age, or gender cannot explain the observed enterotypes, data-driven marker genes or functional modules can be identified for each of these host properties. For example, twelve genes significantly correlate with age and three functional modules with the body mass index, hinting at a diagnostic potential of microbial markers.},
