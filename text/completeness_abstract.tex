Missing descriptors in mammography reports do not necessarily mean that the report does not have all the information to make a correct and justified diagnosis. Conversely, there are cases when most of the descriptors are reported, but the report still reaches an ambiguous diagnosis. Completeness of reports needs to be sensitive to the context of the information already given as well as the effect of missing information on the diagnosis. In this chapter I describe how to measure the information content of a radiological report. Information content being the value of the observations and descriptors in the report with respect to the diagnosis. I first describe a new metric to measure report completeness, then I propose an algorithm to compute this metric, and finally I perform a study that correlates report completeness with errors in radiological interpretation.
