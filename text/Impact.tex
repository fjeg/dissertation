This dissertation contains work that is impactful both in clinical practice and in decision support. My results reveal how current reporting practices can lead to errors in diagnosis and should influence how reporting is done. The results also show how to deliver decision support in the radiological reporting workflow.

\subsection{Improving radiological performance by improving reports}
Though report quality is absolutely necessary for communication, my work is the first to show that low quality reporting is correlated with errors in diagnostic performance. I show how deficiencies in correctness, completeness and consistency of information in the radiological report lead to errors in the radiologist's final assessment. These results should be driving point to further investigate and measure quality of radiological reports in a systemic fashion. 

\subsection{Radiology decision support for reporting}
Reception of radiological decision support outside of CADe is currently tepid, though practicing radiologists recognize the potential value decision support can bring to practice. Computer-augmented practice needs to provide immediate value for clinicians to buy-in to the long-term future promised by informaticians. This is best done by resolving current pain in practice, of which reporting contributes greatly. By delivering decision support during reporting time, we open the door to creating an infrastructure for adoption of these tools.
