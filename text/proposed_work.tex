In the coming months I propose to finish this project by doing the following tasks.

\subsection{Fully evaluate feedback and stopping criteria effects on information accuracy}
I will finish the work on providing feedback to radiologists in real time. I will do this by running all the feedback and stopping criteria pairs on a simulated data set of 10,000 cases and measuring the classification accuracy and number of features selected for each pair. This will demonstrate the optimal feedback and stopping criteria to use in the full FASR project.

\subsection{Evaluate the FASR system in simulated settings}
I will evaluate the full FASR pipeline on a data set of mammography images and reports. I will run each individual component of the FASR system on this simulated radiology reading environment and measure accuracy in diagnosis coupled with efficacy of reporting. This will show whether there is a compromise between thorough reporting and diagnostic accuracy.

\subsection{Evaluate the FASR system with human readers}
I will test the effect of the full FASR system on human readers to measure their improvement in diagnostic accuracy. In addition, given the implicit randomness in subjective human assessment, I will measure whether use of the FASR system reduces diagnostic variability.
