In this concluding chapter I will summarize the main contributions of my work on the FASR project. Then I will describe the contributions I have made to radiology and informatics followed by the impacts of these contributions. Finally I will propose some future research opportunities that can further my vision of a decision support system to aid in the interpretation of radiological images.
