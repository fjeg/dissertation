--Abstract should contain substantive amount of results and conclusions
--Change everything to I, My and past tense

--Introduction: Should be a complete summary of your work including background, problem, your aims, solution/method (including an intuition of methods), key results, contributions, and a guide to the reader for the rest of the chapters.
Each of these should be called out in the ToC. Also, I think you should explain the structure of the 3 main chapters in this guide since each chapter almost stands on its own.

--Background: Spice up the title -- Radiology and Medicine? Go into basic medicine before detailing the need for imaging and then the problems with imaging. 

Also, the literature review should include basic medicine, the imaging literature, the challenges, existing approaches, components/research that motivated your work and how it contributed.
I wonder if there's a chapter on the background of methods stuff
Change to APA, mark likes seeing the author names and years


--Chapter 3-5: I wonder whether you could integrate the "^[a-zA-Z ]+:" into the chapter titles. True for all of your headings. 

--Basic structure comments:
Each chapter should have a summary that ends with a transition to the next chapter
Each chapter should have an introductory paragraph or two that occurs before any section and that: 1) introduces things to the reader and 2) guides them through the reamining sections
There should be text after every heading, no matter what, even if a subheading immediately follows.
discussions should do more than just describe the results. They should "suggest" things, and provide "opportunities". Although the broader implications of a particular result should be saved for the final chapter
almost every figure and table should have a caption/legend
