All the information necessary to make observations about the visual phenotype of the patient is contained in the radiological image. I hypothesized that computer vision techniques could accurately predict the observations a radiologist would make in their report. In this chapter I develop a system to do this prediction by framing the task as a classification problem. First I describe the image processing methods to extract meaningful features from the image, then I describe the classification frameworks for prediction, and finally I show how this framework can assist in verifying radiologist annotations.
