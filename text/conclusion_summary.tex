In this chapter I have summarized the main contributions of my work on the FASR project. I listed the take-away points. Then I summarized how my results have given new insight to the practice of reporting in radiology as well as how decision support has the potential to play a role in image interpretation. I then described the how improving reporting via decision support is impactful to the field. Finally, I provided some future research opportunities for research studies and further methods to seamlessly integrate this analysis into practice.
