\chapter{Conclusions}

This differs from traditional approaches to decision support because our system will improve upon \emph{reporting}, and by our hypothesis, implicitly improve upon practice. By ensuring that the relevant observations are correctly, completely, and consistently described in mammography reports, our decision-support system will reduce variability in practice, improving practitioner decision making, and lead to better patient care.
