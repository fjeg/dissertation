When a radiological report is deemed deficient, the radiologist needs to correct it before signing off on it. While it is possible to simply alert the radiologist that the report is incomplete, a more sophisticated system could elicit the specific changes necessary to fix such deficiencies. In this chapter I describe a framework for requesting feedback from radiologists to fix their reports. First, I describe the background of feedback systems in medical decision making, then I propose a new framework to feedback, finally I evaluate several candidate feedback methods within this framework. I conclude by showing that requesting feedback to improve reports can provide near optimal performance in decision support systems.
