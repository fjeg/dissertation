Decision-support systems have been developed to improve upon mammography interpretation and diagnosis \cite{Garg:2005cb, Burnside:2000wl, ElizabethS:2005gc, Rubin:2005jg}, however most of these systems follow the Greek Oracle model of decision-support: they simply give an answer to the diagnostic task rather then assisting the radiologist to improve their own decision \cite{Miller:1990wg, Friedman:2009dx}. Additionally, such systems interrupt the traditional radiological workflow \cite{Morgan:2011ct}. We posit that improving the radiologistâ€™s report during reporting time mitigates both of these issues and is the ideal time to deliver effective decision-support.
