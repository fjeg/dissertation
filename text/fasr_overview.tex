The Fast Adaptive Structured Reporting (FASR) system's goal is to reduce variability and error in radiological interpretation by providing decision-support during reporting time. This works by incorporating multiple checks during the reporting process and providing real-time feedback to the radiologist.

There are three main components to FASR: (1) Verification of the annotation correctness, (2) verification of reporting completeness and (3) providing feedback to the radiologist. In this chapter, we will explain in-depth how FASR solves these tasks.
