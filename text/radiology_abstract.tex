In this chapter I provide background into the problems and current solutions to decision support in radiological reporting. I begin by describing the clinical applications that I study throughout this text: liver imaging and breast imaging. I then go into the past and present paradigms in radiological reporting. Finally, I describe decision support systems within these two domains, their contributions to the field, and shortcomings that I address in my works.
